  <h2 class='c001'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_4 c004'>I&#8196;am anxious at the first outset that the object
of this work should not be misunderstood.
It does not assume to be a handbook for poets,
or a guide to poetry. The attempt to compile
such a book as is implied by either of those
titles would be as absurd as pretentious.</p>

<p class='c005'>A Poet, to paraphrase the Latin, is created,
not manufactured. Cicero's "nascimur poetæ,
fimus oratores," is, with some modification, even
more to the point. In a word, poetical genius
is a gift, but education and perseverance will
make almost any man a versifier.</p>

<p class='c005'>All, therefore, that this book aims to teach is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>the art of Versification. That art, like Logic,
is "ars instrumentalis, dirigens mentem inter
cognitionem rerum." As Logic does not supply
you with arguments, but only defines the mode
in which they are to be expressed or used, so
Versification does not teach you how to write
poetry, but how to construct verse. It may be
a means to the end, but it does not pretend to
assure its attainment. Versification and Logic
are to Poetry and Reason what a parapet is to
a bridge: they do not convey you across, but
prevent you from falling over. The difference
is that which exists between τεχνη and ἐπιστήμη.</p>

<p class='c005'>This definition is rendered necessary by the
Dogberry spirit which is now abroad, and which
insists that "to be a well-favoured man is the
gift of fortune,"—fortune in the sense of wealth,
I presume,—"but to write and read comes by
nature;" in fact, that to be "a poet" a man
needs to be advantageously placed in the world,
but that any one can "write poetry."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>With this conviction, I have discarded the title
of a guide for "Poets," feeling that there is
much real poetry that is not in verse, and a
vast deal of verse that is not poetry; and that
therefore "a hard and fast line" was of the
first importance to mark the boundary of my
undertaking. Poetry is far less a question of
manner than of matter, whereas versification is
purely a question of form. I will even venture
to say that some of our noblest poems are in
prose; and that many great poets have been
but inferior versifiers. But what these last wrote
has possessed qualities compared with which the
mere mechanism of their verse is as nothing.
The poet gives to the world in his sublime
thoughts diamonds of the purest water. It
would be idle to quibble about minor points of
the polishing and setting of such gems—they
would lose in the process! But the writer of
verse does not—and should not—pretend to give
us diamonds. He offers paste-brilliants; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>therefore it the more behoves him to see
to the perfection of the cutting, on which their
beauty depends.</p>

<p class='c005'>The thoughts presented by the poet may be
rough-hewn; the fancies of the versifier must
be accurately finished, and becomingly set.
Poetry, therefore, abounds in licences, while
Versification boasts only of laws.</p>

<p class='c005'>To enumerate, explain, and define these laws
is the object of this work. Nor is such a task
a waste of time, as those may be inclined to
think, who argue that if one cannot write poetry,
'tis absurd to try to write verse. Yet versification
is an elegant accomplishment to say the
least—"emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."
But it is something more than an elegant accomplishment—much
more.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the dead languages—leaving in abeyance
the question of classical <i>versus</i> mathematical
education—nothing gives such scholarly finish as
the practice of Greek and Latin verse-writing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>nothing such an intimate knowledge and understanding
of the genius of either language.</p>

<p class='c005'>Were English versification taught in our schools,
I believe the boys would acquire a better understanding
and appreciation of their own tongue.
With such training, a lad would shrink from a
mispronunciation as he does from a false quantity
in Latin or Greek. He would not fall into
the slipshod way of pronouncing "doing" as if
it were spelt "doin'," "again" as if "agen,"
and "written and spoken" as if "writtun and
spokun."  He would not make dissyllables of
words like  "fire" and "mire," or of the trisyllable
"really." Nor would he make another
mistake (very common now, as revealed in
magazine verse where such words are put to
rhyme, "before" and "more") of pronouncing
"ure" as "ore,"—"shore" and "asshore" for
"sure" and "assure," of which, of course, the
correct pronunciation is "shewre," "ashewre."<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c006'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>The purging of our pronunciation would be
of general benefit. At present it is shifting and
uncertain—because it is never taught. The
dropping of the "h" is almost the only error
in pronunciation that is ever noticed at school;
and there being no standard set up, the pronunciation
of English becomes every day more
and more degraded by the mere force of the majority
of uneducated vulgar. The Americanising
of our language—which seems to me a less
remote and no less undesirable possibility than
"the Americanising of our institutions," about
which we hear so much—can only be checked
by some such educational system. Surely the
deterioration of our language is not a minor
matter, and when it can be removed by the
encouragement of verse-writing at our schools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>strictly and clearly taught, it seems astonishing
that no effort has been made in that direction.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c006'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>However, whether, by establishing a system of
English versifying at our schools, we shall ever
endeavour to give fixity to our pronunciation, is a
question hardly likely, I fear, to be brought to
the test yet awhile. That English versifying is a
strong educational power, I do not doubt, and in
that belief, have endeavoured to render this handbook
as complete as possible. I have therefore
laid down the most stringent rules and the clearest
formulæ in my power.</p>

<p class='c005'>Verse is but the A B C of Poetry, and the
student must learn his alphabet correctly. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>should not allow a child to arrange the letters as
he chose,—"A, Z, B, G, C,"—nor must the
beginner in verse dream of using any licences
of a similar kind. I should fail in my duty if I
admitted anything of the kind; for while it would
be presumption to lay down laws for poets, it
would be incapacity to frame licences for versifiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>I therefore conclude these prefatory remarks
by adducing the two chief regulations for the
student.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>First, That he must use such rhymes only as</div>
      <div class='line in8'>are perfect to the ear, when correctly pronounced.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>Second, That he must never write a line</div>
      <div class='line in8'>which will not sooner or later in the</div>
      <div class='line in8'>stanza have a line to correspond with a rhyme.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To these I may add, as a rider, this piece of
advice (somewhat in the style of the whist maxim,
"When in doubt, play a trump"): If you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>reason to choose between two styles of versification,
select the more difficult.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is only by sustaining your verse at the highest
elevation that you can hope even to approach
poetry.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Be bold—be bold—but not too bold!"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And bear in mind the words of Sir Philip
Sidney:—"Who shootes at the midday Sonne,
though he be sure he shall neuer hit the marke;
yet as sure he is, he shall shoote higher than
who aymes but at a bush."</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_3 c004'>There is no better text for this chapter than
some lines from Pope's "Essay on Criticism":—</p>

      <div class='line in4'>While expletives their feeble aid do join;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:</div>

      <div class='line in4'>With sure returns of still recurring rhymes;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'</div>
      <div class='line in4'>In the next line it 'whispers through the trees:'</div>
      <div class='line in4'>If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The reader's threaten'd—not in vain—with 'sleep.'</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Then at the last and only couplet, fraught</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A needless Alexandrine ends the song,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, to know</div>
      <div class='line in4'>What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And praise the easy vigour of a line</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>As those move easiest who have learnt to dance.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The sound must seem an echo to the sense.</div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The line, too, labours, and the words move slow.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Johnson sneers somewhat at the attempt at what he
styles "representative metre." He quotes "one of
the most successful attempts,"—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With many a weary step, and many a groan,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Up a high hill he heaves a huge round stone;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The huge round stone, resulting with a bound,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thunders impetuous down and smokes along the ground."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>After admitting that he sees the stone move slowly
upward, and roll violently back, he says, "try the
same numbers to another sense—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"While many a merry tale and many a song</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Cheer'd the rough road, we wish'd the rough road long.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The rough road then returning in a round</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Mock'd our impatient steps, for all was fairy ground."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"We have now," says the Doctor, "lost much of
the delay and much of the rapidity." Truly so!—but
why? The choice of words has really altered the
measure, though not the number of syllables. If we
look at the second line of the first extract, we see how
the frequent use of the aspirate, with a long sound
after it, gives the labour of the ascent. There is
nothing of this in the corresponding line, where the
"r" gives a run rather than a halt to the measure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>But Johnson more decidedly shows how he was mistaken
when he finds fault with Pope's—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The varying verse, the full resounding line,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The long majestic march, and energy divine."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>His objection to this is, that the same sequence of
syllables gives "the rapid race" and "the march of
slow-paced majesty;" and he adds, "the exact prosodist
will find the line of <i>swiftness</i> by one time longer
than that of <i>tardiness</i>." By this it is to be presumed
he alludes to the trisyllabic nature of the first foot of
the first line—"varying." But it is just that which
gives the rapidity. The other half of the line is not
meant to give rapidity, but "resounding." The second
line, by the repetition of the "a" in "march" and
"majesty," gives the tramp of the march to admiration.</p>

<p class='c014'>So much for Johnson's objections. We will now see
how far the lines of Pope can guide us in the construction
of verse.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Third</span> indicates the necessity—which Pope
himself, even, did not adequately recognise—the necessity
of varying the fall of the verse on the ear.
Pope did this by graduating his accents. The line
should scan with an accented syllable following an
unaccented one—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"And smo´oth or ro´ugh, with the´m, is ri´ght or wro´ng."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Pope varied this by a sort of compromise—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"And the´ smooth strea´m in smo´other nu´mbers flo´ws,"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>would be the right scansion. But the accent passes
in a subdued form from "the" to "smooth," which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>pleasantly modulates the line, and gives the flow
required for the figure treated of.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c006'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>But there was another means of varying the verse
which was not in those days adopted. It was not
then recognised that there were some cases in which
the unaccented syllable might have two "beats."
Pope wrote,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Had he written "generous," it might have stood, and
would have given a variety. And this would have
saved the eyesore of such lines as—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"T' admire superior sense and doubt our own."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Fourth</span> does not exactly describe the fault
it commits. "The open vowel" is no offence, but
rather a beauty, though like all beauty it must not be
too lavishly displayed. The fault of the line really
lies in the repetition of the same broad sound—"o."
The same vowel-sounds should not be repeated in a
line.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c006'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This especially holds good where they are so
associated with consonants as to form a rhyme, or
anything approaching to it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>Line Fifth</span> points out an inelegance which no one
with any ear could be guilty of—the use of "do" and
"did," to eke out a line or help a rhyme.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Sixth</span> indicates a practice which those who
have studied Latin versification would avoid without
such a hint, since the nature of the cæsura compels
the avoidance of monosyllables.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Ninth</span>, with the following three lines, warns
against an error which naturally becomes the more
frequent the longer English verse is written, since
rhymes become more and more hackneyed every
day.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Sixteenth.</span> The Alexandrine will come
under discussion in its place among metres.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Twenty-first</span> might well serve for a motto
for this little treatise. If a poet said this of poetry,
how much more does it apply to versification!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Twenty-fifth.</span> Here, and in the following
line, by delicate manipulation of the accent, Pope gets
the desired effect. Instead of "So so´ft the stra´in,"
he attracts the ear with "So´ft is," and the unexpected
word gives the key-note of the line.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Twenty-seventh.</span> It is almost needless to
point out how in this, and the next line, the poet, by
artful management of accent and careful selection of
onomatopoetic words, gives the required assonance to
the lines.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Twenty-ninth.</span> The broad vowels here give
the requisite pause and "deliberation" to the verse.
In the following line, the introduction of "too"—(under
some circumstances it might well come under the condemnation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of Line Fifth)—makes the line labour, and
the open "o" at the end of the line "tires the ear."</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Line Thirty-first.</span> Here the poet gets the slide
of the "s" to give the idea of motion. In the following
line by the elision and the apt introduction of short
syllables he repeats the notion. In my opinion the
artistic skill of Pope is peculiarly observable in the last
few couplets. In the first line in each instance the
effect is produced by the use of a different artifice
from that employed in the second.</p>

<p class='c005'>These rules were of course intended by Pope to
apply only to the measure called "heroic," <i>i.e.</i>, decasyllabic
verse. But, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, they will be
equally applicable to general verse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coleridge in his "Christabel" struck out what he
considered a new metre, which he describes as "not,
properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so
from its being founded on a new principle: namely,
that of counting in each line the accents, not the
syllables. Though the latter may vary from seven to
twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be
only four." This was a decided step in the right direction,
being in truth a recognition of the principle that
measure in English was not exhausted—was, indeed,
hardly satisfied—by the old rule of thumb; that, in
short, it needed a compromise between <i>accent</i> and
<i>quantity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Southey in his "Thalaba" essayed a new style of
versification, of which he writes as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>"It were easy to make a parade of learning by enumerating
the various feet which it admits; it is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>needful to observe that no two lines are employed in
sequence, which can be read into one. Two six-syllable
lines (it will perhaps be answered) compose
an Alexandrine; the truth is, that the Alexandrine,
when harmonious, is composed of two six-syllable
lines. One advantage this metre assuredly possesses;
the dullest reader cannot distort it into discord....
I do not wish the <i>improvisatore</i> time, but something
that denotes the sense of harmony; something like
the accent of feeling; like the tone which every poet
necessarily gives to poetry."</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, by "six syllables" Southey means "six
feet." He was evidently struggling for emancipation
from the old rule of thumb.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of late many eccentricities of versification have
been attempted after the manner of Mr Whitman,
but for these, like the Biblical echo of Mr Tupper's
muse, there seem to be no perceptible rules, even
should it be desirable to imitate them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I would here add a few words of advice to those
who, by the study of our greatest writers, would endeavour
to improve their own style. For smoothness
I should say Waller, in preference even to Pope, because
the former wrote in far more various measures,
and may challenge comparison with Pope, on Pope's
own ground, with "The Ode to the Lord Protector,"
in decasyllabic verse. For music—"lilt" is an expressive
word that exactly conveys what I mean—they
cannot do better than choose Herrick. Add to
these two George Herbert, and I think the student
will have a valuable guide in small space.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />CLASSIC VERSIFICATION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_3 c004'>There is little doubt that the best and easiest
way of learning English grammar is through
the Latin. That English versification cannot be
similarly acquired through the Latin is due to the fact
that the Latin system depends on quantity, and the
English chiefly on accent and rhyme. Nevertheless,
a slight acquaintance with the classic measures will
prove useful to the student of English verse. In the
absence of all teaching of English versification at our
schools, they have done good service in giving our boys
some insight into the structure of verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>The structure of Latin and Greek verse depends on
the quantity—the length or shortness expressed by
the forms  —   ᴗ. A long syllable is equal in duration
to two short syllables, which may therefore take its
place (as it may take theirs) in certain positions. The
combinations of syllables are called feet, of which
there are about nine-and-twenty. Twelve of the most
common are here given:—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Of the styles of verse produced by combinations of
these feet the most important are the Heroic, or
Hexameter; the Elegiac, alternate Hexameters and
Pentameters; and the Dramatic or Iambic. All others
may be classed as Lyrics.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Cæsura (division) is the separation of each verse
into two parts by the ending of a word in the middle
of a certain foot.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c006'><sup>[5]</sup></a> It may be here noted that this
principle (the ending of a word in the middle of a
foot) applies generally to the verse, it being an inelegance
to construct lines of words of which each
constitutes a foot. The well-known line of Virgil,
marked to show the feet, will explain this at a
glance—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Arma vi|rumque ca|no || Tro|jæ qui | primus ab | oris."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In this the cæsura occurs in the third foot, between
<i>cano</i> and <i>Trojæ</i>. But in no case is one foot composed
of one word only.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Hexameter line consists of, practically, five
dactyls and a spondee or trochee. A spondee may
take the place of each of the first four dactyls—and
sometimes, but very rarely, of the fifth. The cæsura
falls in the third foot at the end of the first—and
sometimes at the end of the second—syllable of the
dactyl. In some cases it is in the fourth foot, after
the first syllable. The last word in the line should be
either a dissyllable or trisyllable.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Pentameter is never used alone, but, with a
Hexameter preceding it in the distich, forms Elegiac
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Verse. It consists of two parts, divided by a cæsura,
each part composed of two dactyls (interchangeable
with spondees) and a long syllable.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c006'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The last place in
the line should be occupied by a dissyllabic word—at
least it should not be a monosyllable or trisyllable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Iambic is most commonly used in a six-foot
line of iambics (the trimeter iambic, <i>vide</i> note on
last paragraph). In the first, third, and fifth place
a spondee may be substituted, and there are other
licenses which we need not here enter upon, as the
measure is not of much importance for our purposes.
The cæsura occurs in the third or fourth foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Lyrics are, as a rule, compound verses; different
sorts of feet enter into the formation of the lines; and
the stanzas consist of lines of different kinds, and are
styled strophes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The chief of the lyric measures are the Sapphic and
Alcaic.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sapphic is a combination of three Sapphic
verses with an Adonic.</p>

<p class='c005'>The double line represents the cæsura, which in rare
instances falls a syllable later.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The Alcaic is, like the Sapphic, a four-line stanza.
Its scheme is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lines 1 and 2, —ᴗ   —  |   ᴗ   —  |  —  ||  —    ᴗ    ᴗ  |  —    ᴗ   —ᴗ</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>That is to say, it consists of two eleven-syllable, one
nine-syllable, and one ten-syllable Alcaic lines (Alcaici
hendeka-, ennea-, and deka-syllabici). Much of the
success of the stanza depends on the flow of the third
line, which, according to the best models, should consist
of three trisyllables (or equivalent combinations, <i>e.g.</i>
a dissyllable noun with its monosyllabic preposition).</p>

<p class='c014'>When it is stated that Horace wrote in four or
five-and-twenty lyric measures, it will be obvious
that I cannot exhaust, or attempt to exhaust, the list
of measures in a work like this. The reader will
have acquired some notion of the nature of classic
versification, from what I have stated of Latin composition
applying with unimportant differences to Greek.
Those who have the leisure or the inclination might
do worse than study Greek and Latin poetry, if only
to see if they can suggest no novelties of metre. I
can recall no English verse that reproduces Horace's
musical measure:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Mĭsĕrār' est | nĕqu' ămōrī dărĕ lūdūm | nĕqŭe dūlcī</div>

    <div>Pătrŭǣ vēr| bĕră līnguǣ."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Greek verse seems a less promising field than Latin
at a first glance. But one of the choruses in Aristophanes's
"Plutus" has an exact echo in English verse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>"ἄνδρες φίλοι κὰι δημόται κὰι τοῦ πονεῖν ἐραστάι."</div>
  </div>

<p class='c015'>may fairly run in a curricle with</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"A captain bold of Halifax who lived in country quarters."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The great difficulty of finding a corresponding measure
in English for Latin or Greek verse, on the accepted
theory that the English acute accent answers
to the Latin long quantity, and the grave accent to the
short, will be found in the spondee. We have no
means of replacing the two longs in juxtaposition, and
are compelled to find refuge in what, according to the
accent-quantity theory, is either an iamb or a trochee.</p>

<p class='c014'>I subjoin the following attempts to render a few
Latin metres, commencing with a translation of the
Horatian measure just alluded to:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Hapless lasses who in glasses may not drown those pangs of passion,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or disclose its bitter woes, it's—so they tell you—not the fashion."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Yet this, in spite of the sub-rhymes which give the
swing of the Ionicus (  ᴗ   ᴗ  — ´ — ) may well be read as
a succession of trochees—that is to say, according to
the quantity-accent system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is an attempt at the Sapphic:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Never—ah me—now, as in days aforetime</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Rises o'erwhelming memory—'tis banish'd!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Scenes of loved childhood, cannot ye restore time,</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Though it has vanish'd?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Alcaic measure is essayed in the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Ah woe! the men who gallantly sallying</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Strode forth undaunted, rapidly rallying—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>No longer advancing attack-ward,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rush'd a disorderly tumult backward."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In these, again, the difficulty of exactly replacing
quantity by accent is great—if not insurmountable.
Hence it is that, as a rule, the attempts at giving the
exact reproductions of Latin measures have failed.
Nevertheless I believe that corresponding measures,
suitable to the genius of our language, may be suggested
by a study of the classics.</p>

<p class='c005'>The often-quoted lines of Coleridge on the hexameter
and pentameter appear to me faulty:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"In the hex|ameter | rises || the | fountain's | silvery | column—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In the pen|tameter | aye || falling in | melody | back."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The first feet of both lines are less dactyls than
anapæsts. The cæsura of the first line is not the
"worthier" cæsura. In the second line the monosyllable
is inadmissible in the last place.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here I may as well point out what seems to me to
be a difficulty of English versification which has given
much trouble. The substitution of accent for quantity
is not all that is required to make the best verse.
Quantity enters into the consideration too. A combination
of consonants, giving an almost imperceptible
weight to the vowel preceding them, goes far to disqualify
it for a place as an unaccented syllable. To
my thinking "rises a" would be a better English dactyl
than "rises the," and "falls it in" than "falling in."
But no agglomeration of consonants can make such
a syllable accented. Two lines from Coleridge's
"Mahomet" will evidence this—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>"Huge wasteful | empires | founded and | hallowed | slow</div>
      <div class='line in4'>perse|cution,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Soul-wither|ing but | crush'd the | blasphemous | rites of</div>
      <div class='line in4'>the | Pagan."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Huge wasteful" is not a dactyl, and "ing but" is
certainly not a spondee—nor is "crushed the."
"Hallowed," by force of the broad "o," is almost
perfect as a spondee, on the other hand; as is "empires"
also. Longfellow, in his "Evangeline," has
perhaps done the best that can be done to give an
exact rendering of the Latin hexameter; but Tennyson,
in portions of "Maud," has caught its spirit, and
transfused it into an English form. No poet, indeed,
has done so much as the Laureate to introduce new
or revive old forms of versification, and enrich the
language with musical measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be well to note here that the classic poets
did not forget the use of the maxim which Pope
expresses in the line—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"The sound must seem an echo to the sense."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In this they were greatly assisted by the use of the
quantity, which enabled them the more readily to give
rapidity or weight to their lines. Nothing could
more admirably represent a horse's gallop than the
beat of the words—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Quadrupedante putrem sonittu quatit ungula campum."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The unwieldiness of the Cyclops is splendidly shadowed
in the line—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Monstrum, horrendum, informe, ingens cui lumen ademptum."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>And again the beat of the Cyclopean hammers is well
imitated in the verse—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Illi inter sese magnâ vi brachia tollunt."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Too much stress may easily be laid on this adornment,
and some poets have carried it to excess. But
the beginner in verse will do well not to overlook it.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The Poet Laureate, whose mastery of metre is remarkable,

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />GUIDES AND HANDBOOKS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_3 c004'>The earliest handbook of verse appears to be
that of Bysshe, who is, by the way, described
in the British Museum Catalogue as "the Poet."
The entry is the only ground I can find for so describing
him. He is, however, amusingly hard on
simple versifiers. "Such Debasers of Rhyme, and
Dablers in Poetry would do well to consider that a
Man would justly deserve a higher Esteem in the
World by being a good Mason or Shoe-Maker, than
by being an indifferent or second-Rate Poet." Furthermore,
with touching modesty, he says, "I pretend
not by the following sheets to teach a man to be a
Poet in Spight of Fate and Nature." His "Rules for
making English Verse" are reprinted in the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c014'>His dictionary of rhymes is better than those of
his successors,—perhaps I should say "that" of his
successors, for Walker's has been repeated with all its
errors, or nearly all, in every subsequent handbook.
Bysshe is to be praised for setting his face against what
Walker styles "allowable" rhymes, such as "haste"
and "feast."<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c006'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Bysshe's theory of verse was "the seat of the accent,
and the pause," as distinguished from quantity—that
is, it depended on the number of syllables. As a result
of this undivided devotion, he misses much of the power
to be attained by making the sound the echo of the
sense, as Pope puts it. He proposes to alter a line of
Dryden's from</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"But forced, harsh, and uneasy unto all."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>into</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But forced and harsh, uneasy unto all."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One would fancy the merest tyro would see the intentional
harshness of the line as Dryden wrote it, and its
utter emasculation as Bysshe reforms it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bysshe is strongly in favour of clipping syllables, a
very pitiable error, for the chief drawback of English
as a poetical language is the preponderance of consonants.
He prefers to make "beauteous" dissyllabic,
and "victorious" trisyllabic. He recommends the
elision which makes "bower," "Heaven," "Prayer"
and "higher," monosyllables, and advises the use of
such abortions as "temp'rance," "fab'lous," "med'cine,"
"cov'nant," and even "wall'wing," for wallowing! To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>compensate for these clippings, however, he considers
"ism" a dissyllable!</p>

<p class='c014'>As a consequence of his narrowing verse to a question
of syllable and accent only, he vulgarises many
words unnecessarily. The student of verse who considers
quantity as well as accent will find no difficulty
in reading the following lines without eliding any
vowels.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold."—<i>Milton.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A violet by a mossy stone."—<i>Wordsworth.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With vain but violent force their darts they threw."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"His ephod, mitre, well-cut diadem on."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"My blushing hyacinth and my bays I keep."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Bysshe cuts down to "di'mond," "vi'let," "vi'lent,"
"di'dem," "hy'cinth," words which need no such debasing
elision. As in music two short sharp beats are
equivalent to one long one (two minims = one semi-breve)
so in verse two brief vowels, or syllables even,
are admissible—indeed, at times desirable for the sake
of variety in lieu of one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among less questionable maxims of Bysshe's is one,
"avoid a concourse of vowels," instanced by—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Should th<i>y</i> <i>I</i>ambics swell into a book."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This means, it is to be presumed, "avoid a concourse
of repetitions of one sound," a very necessary rule.
Some poets are careful not to get the same vowel
sound twice in any line. "Avoid ending a verse with
an adjective whose substantive follows in the next
line" is another sound precept, instanced by—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>"Some lost their quiet rivals, some their kind</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Parents."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The same rule applies to the separation of a preposition
from the case which it governs, as exemplified
in—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The daily lessening of our life shows by</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A little dying," &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>With less reason Bysshe condemns alliteration. It is
an artifice that can be overdone, as is often the case
in Poe's poems, and those of Mr Swinburne,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c006'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Following the example of the old <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>,
Bysshe gives an anthology with his guide.
An anthology in a guide to English verse is worse
than useless, for it serves no purpose save to provoke
plagiarism and imitation. Any one who wishes to
write verse will do little unless he has a fair acquaintance
with English poetry—an acquaintance for which
an anthology can never be a substitute; while it will
but cripple and hamper his fancy and originality by
supplying him with quotations on any given subject,
from "April" to "Woman."</p>
<p class='c014'>Walker's Rhyming Dictionary has greater faults,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>but also greater merits than Bysshe's Art of Poetry.
Walker admits and defends "allowable" rhymes.
"It may be objected," he says, "that a work of this
kind contributes to extend poetical blemishes, by
furnishing imperfect materials and apologies for using
them. But it may be answered, that if these imperfect
rhymes were allowed to be blemishes, it would still be
better to tolerate them than cramp the imagination by
the too narrow boundaries of exactly similar sounds."
Now, it is perfectly true, of course, that a <i>poet</i> may
well be allowed to effect the compromise of sacrificing
a rhyme for a thought; but the versifier (for whom
Walker's book is meant) must have no such license.
He must learn to walk before he runs. Yet apart
from this, Walker's argument is singularly illogical;—there
can be no need to catalogue the blemishes, even
on the ground he urges, since the imagination would
suggest the license, not the license stimulate the imagination.
Walker's book being simply mechanical
should have been confined to the correct machinery
of verse, and imagination should have been allowed
to frame for itself the licenses, which it would not
dream of seeking in a handbook.</p>

<p class='c014'>But for this defect, Walker's Dictionary would be
the best book of the sort possible. It contains, beside
an Index in which rhymes are arranged under various
terminations, as in Bysshe's work, a terminational
dictionary of three hundred pages; a dictionary, that
is, in which the words are arranged as in ordinary
dictionaries, save that the last and not the first letter
of the word is that under which it is ranged.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Walker's Index is by no means exhaustive. In
arranging the index of this little book I have added
about a hundred terminations to his list, beside subdividing
headings which have two sounds (as ASH, in
"cash" and "wash"). Walker's <i>Dictionary</i> of rhymes,
though by no means exhaustive, is useful, and is the
only one extant. His <i>Index</i> of rhymes has been copied
so servilely by all compilers of "handbooks of poetry"
that, in dismissing it now, we dismiss all so-called
rhyming dictionaries of later date.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of these recent books there are but two of any note
or importance. One claims to be a "complete practical
guide to the whole subject of English versification"—"an
exhaustive treatise," in which the writer,
by way of simplifying matters, proposes to supersede
the old titles of spondee, dactyl, &amp;c., by the titles of
"march," "trip," "quick," and "revert," and makes
accents intelligible by calling them "backward" and
"forward," with such further lucidities as "hover,"
"main," "midabout," and other technicalities afford.
Its chief characteristic, however, is a decided condemnation
of rhyme altogether, and a suggestion
of the substitution of "assonance," under which
"path" and "ways," and "pride" and "wife" would
do duty for rhyme! The treatise, though spoiled by
pedantic aiming after novelties of nomenclature, and
too assertive language, is worth perusal. But as "a
practical guide" it is at present useless, and will
remain so until English rhyme is disestablished and
disendowed by Act of Parliament. Although its
author modestly describes it as "the first treatise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the kind ever completed," and considers it "will in
no mean degree serve to advance" the study of English
verse, it is to be feared that there is little danger
of its setting the Pierian spring on fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>A more practical "Handbook of Poetry" is the
best work of the kind I have met with, but it is full
of grave errors. It begins with a definition of "Poetry"
which makes it identical with "Verse," and it tends
too much to the side of license in consequence, from
the fact of permitting to the versifier freedoms which
poets only can claim. On rhyme it is singularly inconsistent.
It pronounces as no rhyme "heart" and
"art," which to any but a cockney ear are perfect
rhymes. Yet, a few paragraphs farther on, its only
objection to the coupling of "childhood" and "wildwood"
as a double rhyme, is that it is hackneyed;
whereas it is not a double rhyme at all! In a chapter
on "Imagery," though "metaphor" is catalogued,
"simile" is omitted, and both together reappear under
the needless subdivision "tropes." An anthology is
added, and a dictionary of double and treble rhymes—as
if it were possible to give anything like an exhaustive
list of them in twenty pages!</p>

<p class='c014'>Such being the imperfections, whether of shortcoming
or excess, of the various existing handbooks,
I venture to hope that this little treatise may plead
some excuse for its appearance.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />OF FEET AND CÆSURA.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_3 c004'>The feet most often met with in English verse
are those corresponding with the trochee and
iambus,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c006'><sup>[9]</sup></a> that is approximately. The iambic
is most common perhaps, represented by two syllables
with the accent on the last syllable.   The trochee has
two syllables, with the accent on the first.  An example
of a line in each metre will show the difference—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div class='c003'>"No´t a si´ngle ma´n depa´rted."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Dactyls (an accented followed by two unaccented
syllables) and anapæsts (two unaccented syllables
followed by an accented one) are most frequently
used in combination with the other feet—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

      <div class='line in1'>I´nto her | mu´tiny."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It appears to me preferable to retain the classic
names for these feet, rather than to try and invent
new titles for them. One writer on versification has
attempted to do this, and calls the iambic "march"
measure, and the trochaic "trip." This seems to me
to render the nature of the measure liable to misconstruction,
as if the former only suited elevated
themes, and the latter light ones; whereas the metre
of Hudibras is iambic, and Aytoun's ballad of the
"Battle of Flodden" is trochaic. The truth is, that
the form of the foot has little to do with the "march"
or "trip" of the verse, for "The Bridge of Sighs" is
written in a dactylic form; and, according to the
authority just alluded to, if the trochee be a "trip,"
the dactyl must be a "jig"!</p>

<p class='c014'>By the combinations of these feet in certain numbers
a line is constituted. Those in which two, three,
and four feet occur—dimeters, trimeters, and tetrameters—are
not so general as lines of more feet, and
in these latter a new feature has to be recognised and
provided for—the cæsura or pause. Strictly, the
cæsura causes poetry to be written in lines, the end
of each being a cæsura; but there are other cæsuras
in the line, one or more according to its length. In
the best verse they correspond with a natural pause in
the sense of the words. When they do not, the artificial
punctuation injures the harmony with which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>sound and the sense should flow together. It is by
varying the fall of the cæsura that the best writers of
blank decasyllabic verse contrive to divest it of monotony.
In some of the more irregular forms of verse,
especially when it is unrhymed, the cæsura is all-important,
giving to the lines their rise and fall—a
structure not altogether unlike what has been termed
the parallelism of Hebrew versification.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is scarcely possible to lay down rules for the use
of the cæsura, or pause, in English verse. It differs
from the classic cæsura in falling at the end of both
foot and word. Of its possible varieties we may gain
some idea when we note that, in the decassyllabic
line, for instance, it may fall after each foot, and it is
by the shifting of its place that in this, as in blank
verse, monotony is avoided. In shorter measures,
especially of a lyric nature, it generally falls midway
in the line.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plan of giving to our accentual feet the titles
given to the classical quantitative feet has been strongly
condemned by some writers. I venture to think they
have hardly considered the matter sufficiently. It
must be better to use these meaningless terms (as we
use the gibberish of Baroko and Bramantip in logic)
than to apply new names which, by aiming at being
expressive, may be misleading. But there is something
more than this to be considered. There is in
accent this, in common with quantity, that just as two
shorts make a long, and can be substituted for it, so
two unaccented syllables may take the place of one
rather more accented; or perhaps it will be found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the substitution is due less to the correspondence in
accent alone, than to correspondence of quantity as
well as accent. To put it briefly, these resolutions of
the foot into more syllables are—like similar resolutions
in music—a question of time, and time means quantity
rather than accent. As an instance of this, I may give
the much-quoted, often-discussed line—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The ordinary method of scanning this is to make a
dissyllable of "tired," as if it were "ti-erd," a vulgarism
of which its author would never have been guilty.
The truth is, that the long "i" and the roll of the "r"
correspond in time to a dissyllable, and by changing
the run of the line, carry out perfectly Pope's notion
of the sound echoing the sense.</p>

<p class='c014'>These resolutions, therefore, need a most accurate
ear, and no slight experience. The versifier will do
well, as a beginner, to refrain from attempting them.
When he has gone on writing verse by rule of thumb
until he begins to discover a formality in them that
would be the better for variation, he may fairly try
his hand at it—but not until then. Before that, his
redundancy of syllables would be the result of faulty
or unfinished expression, not the studied cause of a
change in run.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />METRE AND RHYTHM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_4 c004'>I&thinsp;t was scarcely possible to explain what the feet in
verse are without assuming the existence of
lines, in order to give intelligible examples of the
various feet. But the consideration of the construction
of lines really belongs to this chapter.</p>

<p class='c014'>A line is composed of a certain number of feet, from
two to almost any number short of ten or so—if indeed
we may limit the number exactly, for there is
nothing to prevent a man from writing a line of twenty
feet if he have ingenuity enough to maintain the harmony
and beat necessary to constitute verse. As a
rule, we seldom meet with more than eight feet in a
line.</p>

<p class='c014'>A line may consist of feet of the same description,
or of a combination of various feet. And this combination
may be exactly repeated in the corresponding
line or lines, or one or more of the feet may be replaced
by another corresponding in time or quantity. Here
is an instance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I knew | by the smoke that so gracefully curled ...</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And I said | 'if there's peace to be found in the world.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here the iambic "I kne´w" is resolved into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>anapæst, "and I sa´id,"<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c006'><sup>[10]</sup></a>—or rather (as the measure is
anapæstic) the iambic takes the place of the anapæst.</p>

<p class='c014'>When only two feet go to a line, it is a dimeter.
Three form a trimeter, four a tetrameter, five a pentameter,
six a hexameter, seven a heptameter, eight an
octameter, which, however, is usually resolved into two
tetrameters. If the feet be iambics or trochees, of
course the number of syllables will be double that of
the feet—thus a pentameter will be decasyllabic.
When dactyls or anapæsts are used, of course the
number of syllables exceeds the double of the feet.
But there is no necessity for enlarging on this point:
I have given enough to explain terms, with which
the student may perhaps meet while reading up the
subject of versification. As he may also meet with the
terms "catalectic" and "acatalectic," it may be as well
to give a brief explanation of them also. A catalectic
line is one in which the last foot is not completed.
An acatalectic is one in which the line and the foot
terminate together. An extract from the "Bridge
of Sighs," a dactylic poem, will illustrate this.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>"Make no deep | scrutiny</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Into her | mutiny;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Here the fourth and fifth, the eighth and tenth lines
are catalectic. In the first two the last foot needs one
syllable, in the others it requires two. It is scarcely
necessary to point out how such variations improve
and invigorate the measure, by checking the gallop of
the verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have now seen that the line may be composed of
various numbers of the different feet. The next step
to consider is the combination of lines into stanzas.</p>

<p class='c014'>Stanzas are formed of two or more lines. Two
lines are styled a couplet, three a triplet, and four a
quatrain, while other combinations owe their titles to
those who have used them first or most, as in the case
of the Spenserian stanza.</p>

<p class='c014'>The reader will see at once that, each of these kinds
of stanzas being constructible of any of the styles of
line before enumerated, each style of line being in its
turn constructible of any of the sorts of feet described
in a previous chapter, to make any attempt to give an
exhaustive list of stanzas would be to enter upon an
arithmetical progression alarming to think of.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c006'><sup>[11]</sup></a> I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>shall therefore only enumerate a few, giving, as seems
most useful for my purpose, examples of the most
common form of a peculiar stanza, as in the case of
the decasyllabic couplet of Pope, and the nine-line
stanza of Spenser, or the least common, as when, in the
quatrain, it appears preferable to give, instead of the
alternate-rhymed octosyllabic tetrameters which have
been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, such fresh forms as will be
found in the extracts from "The Haunted House," or
Browning's "Pretty Woman."</p>

<p class='c014'>Another species of triplet occurs in the Pope
measure (pentameter-decasyllabic). It is formed by
the introduction, after an ordinary couplet, of a third
line, repeating the rhyme and consisting of eleven
syllables and six feet. Dryden, however, and some
other writers, gave an occasional triplet without the
extra foot. The Alexandrine, <i>i.e.</i>, the six-foot line,
ought to close the sense, and conclude with a full stop.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>THE QUATRAIN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Of this form of stanza the name is legion. Of the
most common styles, the reader's memory will supply
numerous examples. I shall merely give a few of the
rarer kinds. The quatrain may consist practically of
two couplets, or of a couplet divided by a couplet, as
in Tennyson's "In Memoriam." But the usual rule
is to rhyme the first and third, and second and fourth.
The laxity which leaves the two former unrhymed, is
a practice which cannot be too strongly condemned.
Quatrains so formed should in honesty be written as
couplets, but such a condensation would possibly
not suit the views of the mob of magazine-versifiers,
who have inflicted this injury, with many others, upon
English versification.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be well to note here that the rhyme of
the first and third lines should be as dissimilar as
possible in sound to that of the second and fourth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>This is, in fact, a part of the rule which forbids repetitions
of the same vowel-sounds in a line—chief of all,
a repetition of the particular vowel-sound of the
rhyme. The rhymes recurring give a beat which is
something like a cæsura, and when therefore the
rhyme-sound occurs elsewhere than at its correct post
it mars the flow. Here follow a few examples of the
quatrain. I have not specified the syllables or feet, as
the reader by this time will have learned to scan
for himself; and, owing to the varieties of measure,
such a specification would be cumbrous:—</p>

    <div>THE FIVE-LINE STANZA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I am inclined to think this one of the most musical
forms of the stanza we possess. It is capable of almost
endless variety, and the proportions of rhymes, three
and two, seem to be especially conducive to harmony.
It would be curious to go into the question how many
popular poems are in this form. Here are two examples—both
of them from favourite pieces:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>How sweet and fair she seems to be."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Waller</i>, <i>To a Rose</i>.</div>
    </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr Browning frequently uses this stanza, and with
admirable effect. Although he has been accused of
ruggedness by some critics, there is no modern poet
who has a greater acquaintance with the various forms
of verse, or can handle them more ably. The following
are examples of his treatment:—</p>

    <div>THE SEVEN-LINE STANZA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This form is not very common. It may be formed
of a quatrain and triplet; of a quatrain, a line rhyming
the last of the quatrain, and a couplet; of a
quatrain, a couplet, and a line rhyming the fourth line.

or two triplets with a brace of rhyming lines, one after
each triplet.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>THE NINE-LINE STANZA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Of this form the most generally used is the Spenserian,
or the following variation of it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A little, sorrowful, deserted thing,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Begot of love and yet no love begetting;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Guiltless of shame, and yet for shame to wring;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And too soon banish'd from a mother's petting</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To churlish nature and the wide world's fretting,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For alien pity and unnatural care;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Alas! to see how the cold dew kept wetting</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His childish coats, and dabbled all his hair</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Like gossamers across his forehead fair."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Hood</i>, <i>Midsummer Fairies</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Spenserian has the same arrangement of the
rhymes, but has an extra foot in the last line. The
two last lines of a stanza from "Childe Harold" will
illustrate this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To mingle with the universe and feel</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Byron.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The formation of the ten, eleven, twelve, &amp;c.,
line stanzas is but an adaptation of those already
described. A single fourteen-line stanza of a certain
arrangement of rhyme is a sonnet, but as the sonnet
is scarcely versifiers' work, I will not occupy space by
the lengthy explanation it would require. On the
same grounds, I am almost inclined to omit discussion
of blank verse, but will give a brief summary of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>varieties. The ordinary form of blank verse is the
decasyllabic in which Milton's "Paradise Lost" is
written—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Of man's first disobedience and the fruit</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Brought death into the world and all our woe."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This consists of ten syllables with an accented following
an unaccented syllable. It is preserved from
monotony by the varying fall of the cæsura or pause.
It occurs but rarely after the first foot or the eighth
foot, and not often after the third and seventh.
Elisions and the substitution of a trisyllable, equivalent
in time for a dissyllable, are met with, and at
times the accent is shifted, when by the change the
sense of the line gains in vigour of expression, as in—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Once found, which yet unfound, most would have thought</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Impossible."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>According to scansion "most wo'uld," but by the
throwing back of the accent strengthened and distinguished
into "<i>most</i> would have thought." [In
addition to this in the blank verse of the stage, we
find occasionally additional syllables, as—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>"Or to take arms against a sea of troub(les)."]</div>

<p class='c014'>This by no means exhausts the varieties of blank
verse; but, as I have already said, blank verse is, on the
whole, scarcely to be commended to the student for
practice, because it is, while apparently the easiest, in
reality the most difficult form he could attempt. It is
in fact particularly easy to attain the blankness—but
the verse is another matter. The absence of rhymes
necessitates the most perfect melody and harmony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>if the lines are to be anything beyond prose chopped
up into lengths.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are, I should mention before closing this
chapter, many more styles of stanza than I have
named, and many varieties of them. The ode is of
somewhat irregular construction, but like the sonnet
it is, I consider, beyond the scope of those for whom
this book is intended, and it needs not to be discussed
on that account.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />OF RHYME.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_4 c004'>A&#8196;rhyme must commence on an accented
syllable. From the accented vowel of that
syllable to the end, the two or more words intended to
rhyme must be identical in sound; but the letters
preceding the accented vowel must in each case be
dissimilar in sound. Thus "learn," "fern," "discern,"
are rhymes, with the common sound of "ern" preceded
by the dissimilar sounds of "l," "f," "sc." "Possess"
and "recess" do not rhyme, having besides the
common "ess" the similar pronunciation of the "c"
and the double "s" preceding it. The letters "r" and
"l," when preceded by other consonants, so as
practically to form new letters, can be rhymed to the
simple "r" and "l" respectively, thus "track" and
"rack," "blame" and "lame," are rhymes. The same
rule applies to letters preceded by "s," "smile" being
a rhyme to "mile." Similarly "h" and its compound
rhyme, <i>e.g.</i>, "shows," "those," "chose," and any word
ending in "phose" with "hose."</p>

<p class='c014'>The aspirate to any but a Cockney would of course
pass as constituting the needful difference at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>beginning of a rhyme, as in "heart" and "art," "hair" and "air."<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c006'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In the case of "world" and "whirl'd," however, I
fear common usage must compel us to declare against
the rhyme, since the practice of pronouncing the "h"
after "w" is daily becoming more and more uncommon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rhymes are single, double, or treble—or more
properly one-syllabled, two-syllabled, and three-syllabled.
Rhymes of four or more syllables are
peculiar to burlesque or comic verse. Indeed, Dryden
declared that only one-syllabled rhymes were suitable
for grave subjects: but every one must have at his
fingers' ends scores of proofs to the contrary, of which
I will instance but one—"The Bridge of Sighs."</p>

<p class='c014'>Monosyllables or polysyllables accented on the last
syllable are "single" rhymes. Words accented on the
penultimate or last syllable but one supply "double"
rhymes; <i>e.g.</i>, agita´ted, ela´ted. When the accent is
thrown another syllable back, and falls on the antepenultimate
as in "a´rrogate," it is in the first place a
"triple" rhyme. But as in English there is a tendency
to alternate the acute and grave accent, the trisyllable
has practically two rhymes, a three-syllabled and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>one-syllabled—thus "arrogate" and "Harrogate"
rhyme, but "arrogate" may also pair off with
"mate." Nevertheless it is necessary to be cautious
in the use of words with this spurious accent—it is
perhaps better still to avoid them. Such words as
"merrily," "beautiful," "purity," ought never to be
used as single-syllabled rhymes:—even such words
as "merited" and "happiness" have a forced sound
when so used.</p>

<p class='c014'>Elisions should be avoided, though "bow'r" and
"flow'r" may pass muster, with some others. "Ta'en,"
"e'er," "e'en," and such contractions may of course be
used. The articles, prepositions, and such, cannot in
serious verse stand as rhymes, under the same rule
which condemns the separation of the adjective from
its substantive in the next line.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is scarcely necessary to premise that to write
verse decently the student must have a thorough
knowledge of grammar. From ignorance on that score
arise naturally blemishes enough to destroy verse, as
they would poetry, almost. I have seen verses which,
beginning by apostrophising some one as "thou,"
slipped in a few lines into "yours" and "you"—or,
worse still, have said "thou doeth," or "thou, who is."</p>

<p class='c014'>Expletives and mean expressions also must be
excluded. The verse should never soar to "high-falutin,"
or sink to commonplace language. Simplicity
is not commonplace, and nobility is not "high-falutin,"
and they should be aimed at accordingly;—when
you have acquired the one, you will as a rule
find the other in its company.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>When three or more lines are intended to rhyme
together, the common base or accented vowel in each
instance must be preceded by a different sound. For
example "born," "corn," and "borne," will not serve
for a triplet, because, though the first and third are
both rhymes to the second, they are not rhymes to
each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is as well, unless you are thoroughly acquainted
with the pronunciation of foreign languages, to abstain
from using them in verse, especially in rhymes. I
met with the following instance of the folly of such
rhyming in a magazine, not long ago—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Prim Monsieurs fresh from Boulogne's <i>Bois</i>...</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For these the Row's a certain <i>draw</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This is about as elegant as rhyming "Boulogne" and
"Song."</p>

<p class='c014'><i>It</i> is wise—on the principle of rhyme, the difference
of sounds preceding the common base—to avoid any
similarity by combination. For example, "is" is a
good rhyme for "'tis," but you should be careful not
to let "it" immediately precede the "is," as it mars
the necessary dissimilarity of the opening sound of the
two rhymes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let the beginner remember one thing:—rhyme is a
fetter, undoubtedly. Let him therefore refrain from
attempting measures with frequent rhymes, for experience
alone can give ease in such essays. Only the
skilled can dance gracefully in fetters. Moreover,
a too frequent repetition of rhyme at short intervals
gives a jigginess to the verse. It is on this account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>that the use in a line of a sound similar to the rhyme
should be avoided.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c006'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>As a final warning, let me entreat the writer of
verses to examine his rhymes carefully, and see that
they chime to an educated ear. Such atrocities as
"morn" and "dawn," "more" and "sure," "light in"
and "writing," "fought" and "sort," are fatal to the
success of verse. They stamp it with vulgarity, as
surely as the dropping of the "h" stamps a speaker.
Furthermore, do not make a trisyllable of a dissyllable—as,
for instance, by pronouncing "ticklish" "tick-el-ish,"
and if you have cause to rhyme "iron," try
"environ" or "Byron," not "my urn," because only
the vulgar pronounce it "iern," or "apron" "apern," &amp;c.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A metaphor is a figure whereby the one thing,
instead of being likened to the other, is, as it were,
transformed into it, and is described as doing what it
(the other) does.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The last line is a simile, but "the wings of night"
is metaphorical. "A simile," says Johnson, "to be
perfect, must both illustrate and ennoble the subject;
but either of these qualities may be sufficient to
recommend it."</p>

<p class='c014'>Alliteration, when not overdone, is an exquisite
addition to the charm of verse. The Poet Laureate
thoroughly understands its value. Mr Swinburne
allows it too frequently to run riot. Edgar Allan Poe
carried it to extravagance. I select an example from
each:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The moan of doves in immemorial elms,</div>
      <div class='line'>And murmur of innumerable bees."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Tennyson.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The lilies and languors of virtue,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>For the raptures and roses of vice."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Swinburne, Dolores</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Come up through the lair of the lion</div>
      <div class='line in3'>With love in her luminous eyes."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Poe</i>, <i>Ulalume</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The instance from the Poet Laureate is a strong
one—the repetition of the "m" is to express the
sound of the bees and the elms. The alternation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the others is only pleasing to the ear, and the artifice
in the last instance certainly is too obvious. In the
Poet Laureate's lines the alliteration is so ingeniously
contrived that one scarcely would suppose there are
as many as seven repetitions of the "m." In Poe's,
one is surprised to find the apparent excess of alliteration
is due to but four repetitions. But the "l's" are
identical with the strongest beats in the line, whereas
the "m's" in Tennyson's line are interspersed with
other letters at the beats. He uses this artifice more
frequently than those would suspect who have not
closely examined his poems, for he thoroughly
appreciates the truth of the maxim, <i>ars est celare
artem</i>. A few lines from "The Princess" will
illustrate this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>"The baby that by us,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay like a new-fall'n meteor on the grass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Uncared-for, spied its mother and began</div>
      <div class='line'>A blind and babbling laughter, and to dance</div>
      <div class='line'>Its body, and reach its falling innocent arms</div>
      <div class='line'>And lazy ling'ring fingers."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Here a careful study will reveal alliteration within
alliteration, and yet the effect is perfect, for there is
no sign of labour.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under this category may come, I think, a description
of the Rondeau—a poem of which the first few
words are repeated at the end. It was at one time
ruled to be of a certain number of lines, but the restriction
scarcely holds good now. The best rondeau in
the language is Leigh Hunt's:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>"Jenny kiss'd me when we met,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jumping from the chair she sat in;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Sweets upon your list, put that in!</div>
      <div class='line'>Say I'm weary, say I'm sad;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Say that health and wealth have miss'd me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say I'm growing old, but add—</div>
      <div class='line in22'>Jenny kiss'd me!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Elision must be used with a sparing hand. Generally
speaking, a vowel that is so slightly pronounced
that it can be elided, as in "temperance"—"temp'rance,"
may just as well be left in, and accounted
for by managing to get the "quantity" to cover it.
Where it is too strongly pronounced, to cut it out is
to disfigure and injure the line, as in the substitution
of "wall'wing" for "wallowing." That elision is often
used unnecessarily may be seen in the frequency with
which, in reading verse, we—according to most
authorities—elide the "y" of "many"—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Full many a flower is doom'd to blush unseen."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Gray.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here we are told we elide the "y" of "many," and
some would replace "flower" by "flow'r." Yet to the
most sensitive ear these may receive, in reading, their
share of pronunciation, without damage to the flow of
the line, if the reader understands quantity. "To"
is often similarly "elided," as in—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Can he to a friend—to a son so bloody grow?"</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On the other hand, it is as well not to make too
frequent use of the accented "ed," as in "amazéd."
In "belovéd" and a few more words it is commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>used, and does not, therefore, sound strange. In
others it gives a forced and botched air to the
verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>In verse some latitude is allowed in arranging the
order of words in a sentence, but it must not be
indulged in too freely. A study of the style of our
best poets is the only means of learning what is allowable
and what is not; it is impossible to explain it
within the limits of this treatise. It may, however,
be laid down, as a first principle, that no change in
the order of words is admissible, if it gives rise to any
doubt as to their real meaning:—for example, if you
wish to say, "the dog bit the cat," although such an
inversion of construction as putting the objective
before, and the nominative after, the verb, is allowed
in verse, it is scarcely advisable to adopt it, and say,
"the cat bit the dog."</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />OF BURLESQUE AND COMIC VERSE, AND<br /><i>VERS DE SOCIÉTÉ</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_4 c004'>I&thinsp;t will be as well for the reader to divest himself
at once of the notion that verse of this class is
the lowest and easiest form he can essay, or that the
rules which govern it are more lax than those which
sway serious composition. The exact contrary is the
case. Comic or burlesque verse is ordinary verse
<i>plus</i> something. Ordinary verse may pass muster if
its manner be finished, but comic verse must have
some matter as well. Yet it does not on that account
claim any license in rhyme, for it lacks the gravity
and importance of theme which may at times, in
serious poetry, be pleaded as outweighing a faulty rhyme.</p>

<p class='c014'>This style of writing needs skill in devising novel
and startling turns of rhyme, rhythm, or construction,
and can hardly be employed by those who do not
possess some articulate wit or humour—that is to say,
the power of expressing, not merely of appreciating,
those qualities.</p>

<p class='c014'>A defective rhyme is a fault in serious verse—it is
a crime in comic. It is no sin to be ignorant of Greek
or Latin, but it is worse than a blunder, under such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>circumstances, to quote them—and quote them incorrectly.
In the same way, one is not compelled to
write comic verse, but if he does write it, and cannot
do so correctly, he deserves severe handling.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the leading characteristics of this style is
dexterous rhyming—and the legerdemain must be
effected with genuine coin, not dumps. In the very
degree that clever composite rhyming assists in making
the verse sparkling and effective, it must bear the
closest scrutiny and analysation—must be real Moet,
not gooseberry.</p>

<p class='c014'>All, then, that has been said with regard to serious
verse applies with double force to the lighter form of
<i>vers de société</i>. According to the definition of Mr
Frederick Locker, no mean authority, <i>vers de société</i>
should be "short, elegant, refined, and fanciful, not
seldom distinguished by chastened sentiment, and
often playful. The tone should not be pitched high;
it should be idiomatic, and rather in the conversational
key; the rhythm should be crisp and sparkling, and
the rhyme frequent, and never forced, while the entire
poem should be marked by tasteful moderation, high
finish, and completeness: <i>for however trivial the
subject-matter may be,—indeed, rather in proportion to
its triviality,—subordination to the rules of composition,
and perfection of execution, should be strictly enforced</i>."</p>

<p class='c014'>Let me entreat the reader to bear that italicised
sentence in memory when writing any style of verse,
but most especially when he essays the comic or burlesque.</p>

<p class='c014'>No precedent for laxity can be pleaded because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>poets who have at times indulged in such trifling, have
therein availed themselves of the licenses which they
originally took out for loftier writing. <i>Non semper
arcum tendit Apollo</i>, and the poet may be excused for
striking his lyre with careless fingers. But we, who do
not pretend to possess lyres, must be careful about the
fingering of our kits. Apollo's slackened bow offers
no precedent for the popgun of the poetaster.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I have already said, much of the merit of this
style depends on the scintillations, so to speak, of its
rhymes. They must therefore be perfect. When
Butler wrote the much-quoted couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When pulpit, drum ecclesiastick,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was beat with fist instead of a stick."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>he was guilty of coupling "astick" and "a stick"
together as a rhyme, which they do not constitute.
But he who on that account claims privilege to commit
a similar offence, not only is guilty of the vanity of
demanding to be judged on the same level as Butler,
but is illogical. Two wrongs cannot constitute a
right, and all the bad rhyming in the world can be no
extenuation of a repetition of the offence.</p>

<p class='c014'>The results of carelessness in such matters are but
too apparent! The slipshod that has been for so long
suffered to pass for comic verse, has brought the art into
disrepute. In the case of burlesque, this is even more
plainly discernible. It is held in so small esteem, that
people have come to forget that it boasts Aristophanes
as its founder! Halting measures, cockney rhymes,
and mere play on sound, instead of sense, in punning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>have gone near to being the death of what at its
worst was an amusing pastime, at its best was healthy
satire.</p>

<p class='c014'>The purchase of half-a-dozen modern burlesques at
Mr Lacy's, will account for the declining popularity of
burlesque. <i>All</i> of them will be found defaced by defective
rhymes, and cockneyisms too common to provoke
a smile. In the majority of them the decasyllabic
metre will be found to range from six or eight
syllables to twelve or fourteen! Most bear the same
relation to real burlesque-writing, that the schoolboy's
picture of his master—a circle for head and four
scratches for arms and legs—bears to genuine caricature.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most telling form of rhyme in comic versification
is the polysyllabic, and the greater the number of
assonant syllables in such rhymes the more effective
they prove. The excellence is co-extensive, however,
with the unexpectedness and novelty, and there is
therefore but small merit in such a polysyllabic
rhyme as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"From Scotland's mountains down he came,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And straightway up to town he came."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This merely consists of the single rhymes "down"
and "town," with "he came" as a common affix.
Such polysyllables may be admitted here and there in
a long piece, but when they constitute the whole or
even a majority of the rhymes, the writer is imposing
on his readers. He is swelling his balance at his
banker's by adding noughts on the right hand of the
pounds' figure without paying in the cash.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Another feature of this style of verse is the repetition
of rhymes. Open the "Ingoldsby Legends,"<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c006'><sup>[17]</sup></a> which
may be taken as the foundation of one school of comic
verse, and you will scarcely fail to light upon a succession
of rhymes, coming one after the other, like a
string of boys at leap-frog, as if the well-spring of
rhyme were inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although punning scarcely comes within the scope
of this treatise, it may not be amiss to remind those
who may desire to essay comic verse, that a pun is a
double-<i>meaning</i>. It is not sufficient to get two words
that clink alike, or to torture by mispronunciation a
resemblance in sound between words or combinations
of words. There must be an echo in the sense—"a
likeness in unlikeness" in the idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>Proper names should not be used as rhymes. The
only exception is in the case of any real individual of
note—a statesman, author, or actor, when to find a
telling rhyme to the name, a rhyme suggestive of the
habits or pursuits of the owner of that name, has
some merit, especially if the name be long and peculiar.
But to introduce an imaginary name for the
sake of a rhyme, is work that is too cheap to be good.
A child can write such rhyme as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A man of strict veracity</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was Peter James M'Assity."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In composite rhyming the greatest care should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>taken to see that each syllable after the first is
identical in sound in each line. In "use he was" and
"juicy was," the "h" destroys the rhyme, and the difference
in sound in the last syllable (however carelessly
pronounced) between such words as "oakum"
and "smoke 'em" has a similar disqualifying power.
It is scarcely necessary to refer to such inadmissible
couples as "protector" and "neglect her," "birching"
and "urchin," "oracle" and "historical."</p>

<p class='c014'>One trick in rhyming is often very effective, but it
must not be put into force too often. In some instances,
however, it tells with great comical effect, by
affording a rhyme to a word which at first glance the
reader thinks it is impossible to rhyme. Canning, in
the "Anti-Jacobin," used it with ludicrous effect in
Rogero's song, and a few lines from that will illustrate
and explain the trick I allude to:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Here doom'd to starve on water gru-</div>
      <div class='line in1'>-el, never shall I see the U-</div>
      <div class='line in18'>-niversity of Gottingen!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Here the division of the words "gruel" and "University"
has an extremely absurd effect. But the
artifice must be used sparingly, and those who employ
it must beware of one pitfall. The moiety of the word
which is carried over to begin the next line must be
considered as a fresh word occupying the first foot.
There is a tendency to overlook it, and count it as part
of the previous line, and that of course is a fatal error.</p>

<p class='c014'>Parody may be considered as a form of comic versification.
It is not enough that a parody should be in
the same metre as the original poem it imitates. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>is it sufficient that the first line or so has such a similarity
as to suggest the original. In the best parodies
each line of the original has an echo in the parody,
and the words of the former are retained as far as
possible in the latter, or replaced by others very similar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another form of parody is the parody of style, when,
instead of selecting a particular poem to paraphrase,
we imitate, in verse modelled on the form he usually
adopts, the mannerisms of thought or expression for
which any particular writer is distinguished.</p>

<p class='c014'>Examples of both kinds of parody will be found in
the "Rejected Addresses" of James and Horace Smith,
which should be studied together with Hood, Barham,
Wolcot, and Thackeray, by those who would read
the best models of humorous, comic, or burlesque
writing. I may add here that <i>vers de société</i> will
be best studied in the writings of Praed, Prior, and
Moore. From living writers it would be invidious to
single out any, either as models or warnings.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />OF SONG-WRITING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_4 c004'>Although song-writing is one of the most
difficult styles of versification, it is now held
in but little repute, owing to the unfortunate
condition of the musical world in England. "Any
rubbish will do for music" is the maxim of the music-shopkeeper,
who is practically the arbiter of the art
now-a-days, and who has the interests, he is supposed
to represent, so little at heart that he would not scruple
to publish songs, consisting of "nonsense verses"—as
schoolboys call them,—set to music, if he thought
that the usual artifice of paying singers a royalty on
the sale for singing a song would prevail on the public
to buy them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another reason why "any rubbish will do for
music" has passed into a proverb is, that few amateur
singers—and not too many professionals—understand
"phrasing." How rarely can one hear what the words
of a song are! Go to a "musical evening" and take
note, and you will see that, in nine cases out of ten,
when a new song has been sung, people take the piece
of music and look over the words. A song is like a
cherry, and ought not to require us to make two bites
at it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Nor is the injury inflicted on music due only to the
amount of rubbish which is made to do duty for songs.
The writings of our poets are ransacked for "words,"
and accompaniments are manufactured to poems which
were never intended, and are absolutely unfitted, for
musical treatment. Then, because it is found that
poems are not to be converted into songs so easily
as people think, the cry is not merely that "any
rubbish will do for songs," but that "<i>only</i> rubbish
will do,"—a cry that is vigorously taken up by interested persons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The truth lies between the two extremes. A peculiar
style of verse is required, marked by such characteristics,
and so difficult of attainment, that some of
our greatest poets—Byron for one—have failed as
song-writers. English literature reckons but few
really good song-writers. When you have named
Moore, Lover, Burns, and Barry Cornwall, you have
almost exhausted the list.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is in the last edition of the works of the
lamented writer I have just named—Samuel Lover—a
preface in which he enters very minutely into the
subject of song-writing. The sum of what he says is,
that "the song being necessarily of brief compass, the
writer must have powers of condensation. He must
possess ingenuity in the management of metre. He
must frame it of open vowels, with as few guttural or
hissing sounds as possible, and he must be content
sometimes to sacrifice grandeur or vigour to the necessity
of selecting <i>singing</i> words and not <i>reading</i> ones."
He adds that "the simplest words best suit song, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>simplicity must not descend to baldness. There must
be a thought in the song, gracefully expressed, and it
must appeal either to the fancy or feelings, or both,
but rather by suggestion than direct appeal; and
philosophy and didactics must be eschewed."</p>

<p class='c014'>He adduces Shelley, with his intense poetry and
exquisite sensitiveness to sweet sounds, as an instance
of a poet who failed to see the exact necessities of
song-writing, and gives a quotation from one of
Shelley's "songs" to prove this. The line is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The fresh earth in new leaves drest."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and he says very pertinently, "It is a sweet line, and
a pleasant image—but I defy any one to sing it:
<i>nearly every word shuts up the mouth instead of
opening it</i>." That last sentence is the key to song-writing.
I use the word song-writing in preference to
"lyrical writing," because "lyrical" has been warped
from its strict meaning, and applied to verse which
was not intended for music. It is not absolutely
necessary that a song-writer should have a practical
knowledge of music, but it is all the better if he have:
beyond doubt, Moore owed much of his success to his
possession of musical knowledge.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>ENGLISH VERSIFICATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_4 c004'>I&thinsp;n normal English Verse, the most determinate
characteristic is uniformity of syllabic structure.
<span class='sc'>Rhyme</span>, indeed, is a common but not an essential
adjunct, some of our noblest poems being composed
in unrhymed or Blank Verse. <span class='sc'>Measure</span>, <span class='sc'>Rhythm</span>,
<span class='sc'>Accent</span>, and <span class='sc'>Pause</span>, are all features of much moment
in English Versification, but they cannot be reduced
to absolutely uniform rules. The variations to which
they are subject are many and important. Of the
positive and correct signification of the terms Rhyme,
Measure, Rhythm, Accent, and Pause, it is needful to
give some explanation.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Rhyme</span> consists in a likeness or uniformity of sound
in the closing, syllable, or syllables, of successive or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>contiguous lines of verse. We find used, in English
poetry, three several sorts of Rhymes, namely, Single,
Double, and Treble. Of the first, or one-syllabled
rhyme, the following is an example:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"O, mortals, blind in fate, who never know</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To bear high fortune, or endure the low!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The closing word, however, is not necessarily a monosyllable.
There may be two syllables, as here:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"What though his mighty soul his grief contains,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He meditates revenge who least complains."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or three:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Seeking amid those untaught foresters,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If I could find one form resembling hers."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or four:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"We might be otherwise—we might be all</div>
      <div class='line in1'>We dream of, happy, high, majestical."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or there might be any number in this kind of verse
under ten, if the long and short (accented and unaccented)
syllables were rightly placed, and if the penultimate
syllable, in particular, was short or unaccented.
It is only to be observed further, that it is
the sound in which uniformity is required, and not the
spelling. Thus the following words make good rhymes:—made,
plaid, and stayed; course, force, and hoarse;
ride, lied, dyed; be, glee, lea; lo, blow, foe; beer,
clear, here, and so forth. The most perfect single
rhymes in our language, however, are those in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the rhyming vowels of two lines, and their closing
letter or letters (if there be any), are exactly the same.
"So" and "no," "day" and "say," "content" and
"unbent," "oculist" and "humorist," "ambassadress"
and "unhappiness"—all of these are perfect rhymes,
seeing that the consonant preceding the rhyming
vowel varies in each pair of words, all being alike
after it. This is the criterion of an absolutely perfect
rhyme.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c006'><sup>[20]</sup></a> However, such, rhymes as "away" and
"sway," "strain" and "drain," "tress" and "dress,"
are not unfrequently used in good poetry. But those
rhymes are held decidedly bad which merely repeat
the same sounds, whether the words spell alike or not.
Thus "amid" and "pyramid," "light" and "satellite,"
"maid" and "made," are defective rhymes. In short,
it may be laid down as a rule, that, where the immediate
consonants are not varied before the vowels
in two rhyming lines, the letters before these consonants
must be markedly different, as in "strain" and
"drain," to make the rhymes at all good. "Away"
and "sway," or "loud" and "cloud," though tolerated,
are imperfect in a strict sense. No rhymes are more
uncertain, it may be observed, than those of words
ending in <i>y</i>, as "privacy," "remedy," and the like.
In monosyllables and dissyllables so ending, as "try"
and "rely," the termination always rhymes to <i>ie</i>, as in
"vie" or "hie;" and it seems right that <i>y</i> should always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>so be rhymed.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c006'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Nevertheless, it as often rhymes to
an <i>e</i>, as in "be" and "she." The plural of nouns in
<i>y</i>, again, having their termination in "ies," rhyme very
uncertainly. They are sometimes placed to correspond
with "lies," and sometimes with "lees." There is no
fixed rule on this subject.</p>

<p class='c005'>On many other points, also, the student of English
poetry must gather information for himself from reading
and observation. Of Double Rhymes it is not
necessary to say much here. They are formed by
adding a short or unaccented syllable to the measure
of ordinary verses of any kind, and composing the
rhyme out of it and the preceding syllable, now the
penultimate one. Thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Then all for women, painting, rhyming, <i>drinking</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Besides ten thousand freaks that died in <i>thinking</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In grave poetry, which uses the double rhyme occasionally,
but on the whole sparingly, the last or short
syllable should be entirely alike in double rhymes,
and to the penultimate or accented one the same rules
should apply as in the case of perfect single rhymes.
That is to say, the consonants preceding the accented
vowels should be varied, though licenses are taken in
this respect. "Trading" and "degrading," for example,
would be held a passable rhyme. The unison
of sound,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c006'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and not the spelling, largely guides the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>formation of double rhymes, even in serious verse.
"Liquor" and "thicker," "ever" and "river," "motion"
and "ocean," "debtor" and "better," are instances in
proof; and many, many worse cases pass muster
occasionally. Faulty double rhymes are rendered
faulty much in the same way as single ones. Thus,
"minion" and "dominion," "million" and "vermilion,"
are bad rhymes. In burlesque and satiric
poetry, a great deal of freedom is used in the composition
of double rhymes.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c006'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Butler often frames them
most amusingly in his "Hudibras." For example—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When pulpit, drum ecclesi<i>astic</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was beat with fists, instead of <i>a stick</i>."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>"Though stored with deletery <i>med'cines</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which whosoever took is <i>dead since</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Occasionally in the highest serious verse we find the
double rhyme composed of two several words, as in
the following specimen from Wordsworth:<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c006'><sup>[24]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Through many a long blue field of ether,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In light or burlesque pieces, however, as Butler shows,
the double rhyme is compounded in any way which
gives the sound required. The Treble Rhyme is only
found in such pieces. Butler says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"There was an ancient sage philosopher,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who had read Alexander Ross over."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>But, as the treble rhyme occurs but three or four
times even in "Hudibras," it need not be dilated on here.</p>

<p class='c014'>The word <span class='sc'>Measure</span>, when employed in reference to
poetry, indicates the length of line and general syllabic
structure of peculiar kinds and forms of verse. Thus,
a piece written in lines of eight syllables is said to be
in the octo-syllabic measure, and one of ten-syllabled
lines in the deca-syllabic measure. The term <span class='sc'>Rhythm</span>,
again, denotes the arrangement of the syllables in
relation to one another, as far as accentuation is concerned,
and the particular cadence resulting from that
arrangement. All the common measures of verse have
a prevailing and normal rhythm—that is, long and
short, or accented and unaccented, syllables follow
each other in a certain order of succession. Thus, the
normal octo-syllabic measure consists of short and
long alternately, as does also the deca-syllabic. But
variations, as will be shown, occur in these respects.
What rhythm, again, is to measures of verse in the
aggregate, <span class='sc'>Accent</span> nearly is to each line specifically
and individually. In one and all has the accent its
peculiar seat; and the more that seat is varied,
generally speaking, the more beautiful is the verse.
The <span class='sc'>Pause</span> is another feature of some importance in
English poetry. In every line a point occurs, at which
a stop or rest is naturally made, and this independently
of commas or periods. It will be found impossible to
read poetry without making this pause, even involuntarily.
The seat of it varies with the accent, seeing
that it always follows immediately after the accent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>From the want of a right distribution of accent and
pause verse becomes necessarily and unpleasingly monotonous.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the whole, English poetry, as remarked, has not
one well-marked and unvariable characteristic of
structure, saving that syllabic uniformity which distinguishes
it in all its accurate forms and phases.
However, this feature of our verse has been far from
stamping it with anything like sameness. Though
our bards have habitually measured their verses by
the syllabic scale—with the exception of our old ballad
writers, and a few moderns, who have written professedly
after their exemplars—yet no language in the
world contains stores of poetry more varied than the
English in respect of construction. Lines of all
lengths, containing from three syllables to twenty,
have been tried by our poets, and, in general, pleasingly
and successfully. Fletcher has even attempted
tri-syllabic verses, though, as may be supposed, only
in a slight choral form.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Move your feet</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To our sound,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whiles we greet</div>
      <div class='line in3'>All this ground."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In verses of four syllables, again, pretty long poems
have actually been composed, and particularly by
John Skelton, a poet of the time of Henry VIII.
Much of what he wrote was sheer doggerel, no doubt
being rendered so partly by the nature of his own
talent and disposition, and partly because his chosen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>form of verse would scarcely admit of the conveyance
of serious sentiments. Now and then, however, he
does contrive to make his miniature lines interesting,
as in the following address to Mistress Margaret Hussey:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Merry Margaret,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As midsummer flower,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Gentle as falcon,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or hawk of the tower;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With solace and gladness,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Much mirth and no madness.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>All good and no badness;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So joyously,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So maidenly,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So womanly,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Her demeaning,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In every thing</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Far, far passing</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That I can indite</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or suffice to write</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of merry Margaret,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As midsummer flower,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Gentle as falcon,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or hawk of the tower."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It will be observed that Skelton, while taking four
syllables for the basial structure of his lines, uses five
occasionally, forming either a dissyllabic ending, or
giving two short syllables for a long one, as in the lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Gentle as <i>falcon</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or hawk <i>of the</i> tower."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>At the same time it will be noticed, that the same
number of accents, or accented syllables, is kept up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>throughout. This will be found to be the case with
most of our irregular or ballad compositions. They
vary as to the number of syllables, but not of long
ones or accents. Scott's romantic poetry exemplifies
the same fact, which is a striking one, and explains
why the melody of ballad-verses is so little affected by
their syllabic irregularities. This law of composition
should be specially noted by young cultivators of the
Muses. Dryden has used four syllables in verses of
the choral order. Thus he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To rule by love,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To shed no blood,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>May be extoll'd above;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But here below,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Let princes know,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>'Tis fatal to be good."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is obvious that the four-syllabled line is much too
curt to allow of its being habitually used in serious
compositions. The same thing may be said of lines
of five syllables. They have been, and can only be,
introduced in minor pieces. And here it may be observed,
that the measure of four syllables, when used
gravely, is of simple rhythm, consisting of a short and
long syllable alternately, as in the verses of Dryden.
Skelton, indeed, has confined himself to no rule. The
measure of five syllables necessarily changes its
rhythm; and the second and fourth lines of the subjoined
stanza show what may be called the normal form of the measure:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"My love was false, but I was firm</div>
      <div class='line in3'>From my hour of birth;</div>
      <div class='line in1'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Upon my buried body, lie</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Lightly, gentle earth."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Long and short syllables (three long or accented) occur
here in alternation, and compose the line in its regular
rhythmical shape. Some other lines of an odd number
of syllables, as seven, are for the most part similarly
framed. But, in these respects, variations are often
adopted. For instance, the following five-syllabled
verses are differently constructed:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Now, now the mirth comes,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>With cake full of plums,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where bean's the king of the sport here;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Besides, we must know,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The pëa also<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c006'><sup>[25]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in1'>Must revel as queen in the court here.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Begin then to choose</div>
      <div class='line in3'>This night, as ye use,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who shall for the present delight here;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Be king by the lot,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And who shall not</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Be Twelfth-day queen for the night here."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The first, second, fourth, and fifth lines here do not
present alternate long and short syllables, as in the
former quotation. But, however poets may indulge in
such variations, the alternation of longs and shorts
constitutes the proper rhythmical arrangement in the
measure of verse now under notice. Without three
accents, indeed, the five-syllabled verse becomes but a
variety of the four-syllabled, as in Skelton's pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>In the measure of six syllables, we find many beautiful
pieces wholly and continuously composed, grave
as well as gay. Drayton, for example, has a fine
"Ode written in the Peaks," of which the ensuing
stanza may give a specimen:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"This while we are abroad,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Shall we not touch our lyre?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Shall we not sing an ode?</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Shall all that holy fire,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In us that strongly glow'd</div>
      <div class='line in3'>In this cold air expire?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In a mixed and lyrical shape, the six-syllabled line is
also used finely by Shakspeare:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thou art not so unkind</div>
      <div class='line in3'>As man's ingratitude;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thy tooth is not so keen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Because thou art not seen,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Although thy breath be rude.</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Heigh ho! sing heigh ho!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It is only as we come to consider verses of some
length, that the subject of Accent and Pause can be
clearly illustrated by examples. The Accent practically
consists in either an elevation or a falling of the
voice, on a certain word or syllable of a word, when
verse is read; and that word or syllable is called the
seat of the Accent. The term Rhythm has nothing to
do with the sense; whereas the Accent rests mainly on
the sense; and on the sense, moreover, of each individual
line. The Pause, again, was before stated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>be a rest or stop, made in pronouncing lines of verse,
and dividing each, as it were, into two parts or hemistiches.
Though, in the six-syllabled measure, the
brevity of the lines confines the reader in a great
degree to the ordinary rhythm, which consists of a
short and long syllable alternately, or three unaccented
and three accented, yet, in Drayton's ode,
though the lines cannot well exemplify the Pause,
there is a slight variation in the seat of the Accent—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Shall we not touch our lyre?</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Shall we not sing an ode?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The accent here plainly falls on the initial "shall,"
giving force to the interrogation. Shakspeare's "Under
the green-wood tree" is similarly accented.</p>

<p class='c005'>The seven-syllabled measure is one in which many
exquisite poems have been composed by English
writers. Raleigh used it, as did likewise Shakspeare
many incidental passages in his plays, and afterwards
Cowley, Waller, and other bards of note. But it was
by Milton that the seven-syllabled verse was developed,
perhaps, to the greatest perfection, in his immortal
"L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso." In its systematic
shape, this species of verse consists of a long and
short syllable in alternation, the long beginning and
closing each line, and therefore giving four accents.
The measure is graceful and easy exceedingly, though
apt to become monotonous in enunciation. To obviate
this effect, Milton, who, either from natural fineness of
ear, or from observation and experience, had acquired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>a consummate mastery of rhythm, roughened his lines
purposely, sometimes by introducing eight syllables,
and sometimes by varying the seat of the accent.
This will partly be seen in the following brief extracts,
which will also show how admirably he could make
the measure the vehicle either of the gay or the grave:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Jest and youthful Jollity,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And love to live in dimple sleek;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sport that wrinkled care derides,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Laughter holding both his sides."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>So speaks the poet to Euphrosyne; and now he addresses
"divinest Melancholy:"—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Come, pensive nun, devout and pure,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sober, steadfast, and demure,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>All in a robe of darkest grain,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Flowing with majestic train,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And sable stole of cypress lawn,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Over thy decent shoulders drawn.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Come, but keep thy wonted state,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With even step and musing gait,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And looks commercing with the skies."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It will be observed how finely the dancing effect of the
seven-syllabled verse is brought out, in accordance
with the sense, in the first quoted passage, and with
what skill it is repressed in the second, principally by
the use of the graver octosyllabic line. John Keats
employed the measure now under consideration very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>beautifully in his "Ode to Fancy," and gave it variety
chiefly by changing the ordinary rhythm. Thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Sit thou by the ingle, when</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The sear faggot blazes bright,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Spirit of a winter's night."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The second line, from the position of "sear faggot," is
rendered so far harsh, and tends to prevent the "linked
sweetness" from being too long drawn out, and cloying
the ear. Shakspeare—what under the sun escaped
his eye?—had noticed the sing-song proclivities of the
seven-syllabled measure, since he makes Touchstone
say, on hearing a sample, "I'll rhyme you so eight
years together; dinners, and suppers, and sleeping
hours excepted; it is the right butter-woman's rank
(trot) to market. For a taste." And he gives a
taste:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"If a hart do lack a hind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Let him seek out Rosalind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If the cat will after kind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So, be sure, will Rosalind.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such a nut is Rosalind."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"This is the very false gallop of verses," continueth
the sententious man of motley. He is partly in the
right; but the reader has now been told in what way
the great poets, who have employed this measure of
verse effectively, overcame the difficulties attending its
perfect composition. In speaking of long syllables,
they were before called accents; but the reader must
guard against confounding these with the proper single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>accent, occurring in each line, and connected with the
sense, as well as with the pause. As exemplifying
both such accent and pause in the seven-syllabled line,
the following couplets may be cited from Cowley.
The accent is on the third syllable, the pause at third
and fourth, as marked:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Fill the bowl—with rosy wine,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Round our temples—roses twine;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Crown'd with roses—we contemn</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Gyges' wealthy—diadem."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>These pauses must not be deemed arbitrary. The
tongue is compelled to make them in the act of utterance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The octosyllabic measure has been long the most
common, if not the most popular, of all forms of
English verse. It was in use among the Romancers
of the Middle Ages, before England possessed a
national literature, or even a proper national language.
"Maister Wace" composed in this measure his
"Roman de Rou;" and it was adopted by many of
the early "Rhyming Chroniclers," and "Metrical
Romancers" of Great Britain. Father Chaucer also,
though his noblest efforts were made in what became
the heroic verse (the decasyllabic) of his country, produced
many pieces in the eight-syllabled measure; and
Gower used it solely and wholly. So likewise did
Barbour in his famous history of the Bruce, and Wyntoun
in his Metrical Chronicle of Scotland. Since
their days to the present, it has been ever a favourite
form of verse among us, and, indeed, has been at no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>period more popular than during the current century.
At the same time, poems of the very highest class,
epic or didactic, have never been composed in the
octosyllabic measure. It wants weight and dignity
to serve as a fitting vehicle for the loftiest poetic inspirations.
It has been the basis, however, of much
of the finest lyrical poetry of England. It has likewise
been splendidly wielded for the purposes of
satire, as witness the burlesque or comic epos of
Butler, and the works of Swift. And, in our own
immediate age, it has been magnificently employed by
Scott, Moore, Byron, Campbell, and others, in the
composition of poetical romances.</p>

<p class='c014'>Byron spoke of the octosyllabic verse as having
about it "a fatal facility"—meaning that, from its
simple brevity of construction, it was too apt to degenerate
into doggerel. It is almost needless to give examples
of a species of poetry so well known. Though
the lines thereof are too short to permit of very full
variety of cadence or emphasis, yet these are always
marked and traceable, more or less. As graceful and
flowing octosyllables, the following lines from the
"Tam o' Shanter" of Burns have not many equals in our poetry:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But pleasures are like poppies spread;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You seize the flower—its bloom is shed;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or like the snow-falls in the river,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A moment white, then gone for ever;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or like the Borealis race,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That flit ere you can point their place;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or like the rainbow's lovely form,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Evanishing amid the storm."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Long and short syllables alternately form the regular
rhythm of this kind of verse; but occasional changes
of rhythm and accentuation are used by all good
writers. In the following lines Andrew Marvel introduces
finely such a change:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"He hangs in shades the orange bright,</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Like golden lamps in a green night</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The emphasis is sometimes placed on the first syllable,
as in the subjoined:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Fling but a stone—the giant dies."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Smoothing the rugged brow of night."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The decasyllabic verse, however, will allow more fully
of the illustration of the subjects of Accent and Pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the meantime, a word, and only a word, requires
to be said regarding verses of nine syllables. Such
verses, in their normal and most natural shape, start
with two short syllables, followed by a long one; and
the same arrangement, repeated twice afterwards successively,
completes the line. It has thus but three
accented to six unaccented vowel-sounds. Few poets
of any repute have used this measure extensively, if
we except Shenstone, to whose style it gives an almost
unique caste. For example—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Not a pine in my grove is there seen,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But with tendrils of woodbine is bound;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Not a beech's more beautiful green,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But a sweet-briar entwines it around.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>One would think she might like to retire</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To the bower I have labour'd to rear;</div>
      <div class='line in1'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Not a shrub that I heard her admire,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But I hasted and planted it there."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Shenstone often introduces eight syllables only, as in
the following stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Ye shepherds, so cheerful and gay,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Whose flocks never carelessly roam,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Should Corydon's happen to stray,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Oh! call the poor wanderers home."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But he here retains the proper rhythm of the measure
of nine syllables, and the lines just quoted may rightly
be looked on as still in that verse, though defective in
a syllable. There are several modes of writing the
same measure, different from that of Shenstone, but it
may suffice to notice one instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When in death I shall calmly recline,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Oh bear my heart to my mistress dear;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tell her it lived upon smiles and wine</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Of the brightest hue, while it linger'd here."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>These lines are far from being very musical in themselves,
and were only so written to suit precomposed
music. They are indeed positively harsh, if read without
a recollection of that music, and confirm the remark
made, that each numerical assemblage or series
of syllables appears to have only one kind of rhythm
proper and natural to it, and apart from which it is
usually immelodious.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ten-syllabled line is the heroic one of the English
language, and a noble one it is, rivalling the lofty
hexameter of Greece and Rome, and casting utterly
into the shade the dancing, frivolous epic measure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>French poetry. The latter runs in this rhythmical fashion:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And in this measure is composed the "Henriade" of
Voltaire, with all the famed tragedies of Corneille and
Racine, as well as the pungent satires of Boileau. How
characteristic of the Gaul the adoption and use of such
a sing-song form of heroic verse! The decasyllabic
line of England is of a more dignified caste, while, at
the same time, capable of serving far more numerous
and varied purposes. "All thoughts, all passions, all
delights, whatever stirs this mortal frame," it has been
found fitted to give expression to in a manner worthy
of the themes. A glorious vehicle it proved for the
inspirations of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Jonson,
Beaumont, Fletcher, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Thomson,
Akenside, Young, Goldsmith, Cowper, and other bards
of past generations; while scarcely less magnificent
has been the handling of the same measure by the
poets of the last age, the third great one in our literary
annals. Crabbe, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Rogers,
Campbell, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats, with
other recent poets of deserved renown, have all wielded
the decasyllabic line, with or without rhyme, with success,
as well as with singularly varied ability. A long
list of dramatists of the Elizabethan, Annean, and
Georgean eras, has of course to be added to the roll
now given.</p>

<p class='c014'>The heroic or epic measure of English verse consists
of ten-syllabled lines, each of which, in its ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>rhythmical form, presents a short and long syllable
alternately. The length of the line enables us distinctly
to trace in it both accent and pause; and it is
upon frequent changes in the seats of these that the
varied harmony of the heroic measure depends. The
general accentuation falls on the long syllables, the
sense, however, always directing the reader to accent
some single syllable specially in each line. The pause
uniformly follows the syllable or word so accented
specially, unless that syllable be the first part of a
long word, or be followed by short monosyllables.
Thus, in the following lines the accent is severed from
the pause.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c006'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Both are marked:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"As bu´sy—as intentive emmets are."</div>
      <div class='line'>"So fresh the wou´nd is—and the grief so vast."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Those seats of lu´xury—debate and pride."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The pause is usually marked by a comma or period,
but this, as before said, is not necessarily the case. In
reading the decasyllabic line, a pause must somewhere
be made, whether or not the sense be divided
by points of any kind. The writings of Pope
exemplify strikingly the formal or normal rhythm,
accent, and pause of the heroic line, and a quotation
may be made to exhibit these fully. The pause is
marked in each line, and the same mark shows the seat of the accent:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>"Here as I watch'd´ the dying lamps around,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>From yonder shrine´ I heard a hollow sound.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Come, sister, come´! (it said, or seem'd to say)</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thy place is here´; sad sister, come away;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Once like thyself´, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Love's victim then´, though now a sainted maid:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But all is calm´ in this eternal sleep;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Here grief forgets to groan´, and love to weep;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Even superstition´ loses every fear,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For God, not man´, absolves our frailties here."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This passage contains the secret of that smoothness
which so peculiarly characterises the versification of
Pope. In the preceding fourteen lines, the accent and
the pause are seated, in all save three instances, at
the same or fourth syllable; or rather the seat of
the accent is only once altered (at the twelfth line),
while the pause, changed there, is also changed in the
fourth and thirteenth lines, where it occurs on the
fifth and short syllables in the words "echoes" and
"superstition," the accent remaining on the fourth in
both cases. Now, the versification of Pope is by no
means so monotonous at all times, but it is sufficiently
marked by the peculiar features exhibited here—that
is, the reiterated location of the accent and pause near
the middle of each line, with the pause most frequently
at long syllables—to render his verses smooth even to
a wearisome excess. It is this characteristic of structure,
often felt but seldom understood, which distinguishes
the poetry of Pope from that of almost
every other writer of note in the language. Darwin
resembles him most closely, though the latter poet
had marked peculiarities of his own. He emphasised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>more particularly nearly one-half the first syllables of
his lines. Verse after verse runs thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Sighs in the gale, and whispers in the grot."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Spans the pale nations with colossal stride."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The sweetness here is great, but, most undoubtedly,
verse possessed of a much more perfect and uncloying
species of melody has been produced by those poets
who have admitted greater variety into the composition
of their lines. The licence used by Shakspeare, for
example, in respect of rhythm, accent, and pause, is
unlimited; and beautiful, indeed, are the results:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The quality of mercy´ is not strain'd.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>It droppeth´ as the gentle dew from heaven</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Upon the place beneath´. It is twice bless'd:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>It blesseth him that gives´, and him that takes;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest´; it becomes</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The throned monarch´ better than his crown;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>It is an attribute´ to God himself."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Sweet´ are the uses of adversity,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which, like a toad´, ugly and venomous,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Wears yet a precious jewel´ in his head."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I know a bank´ whereon the wild thyme blows,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where oxlips´ and the nodding violet grows,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Quite over-canopied´ with lush woodbine,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With sweet musk-ro´ses, and with eglantine."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is unnecessary to multiply examples of this sort.
The decasyllabic line of Shakspeare is varied in
structure, as said, almost unlimitedly, the seat of the
accent and pause being shifted from the first word to
the last, as if at random, but often, in reality, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a fine regard to the sense. Ben Jonson, and indeed
all our older writers, indulge in the like free variations
of the heroic measure; and the poets of the present
day, in imitating their higher qualities, have also
followed their example in respect of mere versification.
Wordsworth and Keats, perhaps, may be held as
having excelled all the moderns, their contemporaries,
in the <i>art</i> of "building the lofty rhyme." Both
attended specially to the subject, deeming it by no
means beneath them to meditate well the melody of
single lines, and the aptitude even of individual words.
Hence may Coleridge justly praise Wordsworth for
"his austere purity of language," and "the perfect
appropriateness of his words to the meaning"—for his
"sinewy strength" in isolated verses, and "the frequent
<i>curiosa felicitas</i> of his diction."  But Wordsworth
himself owns his artistic care and toil in composition
even more strongly:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When happiest fancy has inspired the strains,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>How oft the malice of one luckless word</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Pursues the Enthusiast to the social board,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Or haunts him lated on the silent plains!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The beauties of the Bard of Rydal are, at the same
time, too widely spread to render him the best example
for our present purpose. Keats attended more closely
to the minutiæ of pure versification in single passages,
and may furnish better illustrations here. The subjoined
Arcadian picture displays exquisite ease and
freedom of composition:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>"Leading the way´, young damsels danced along,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>As may be read of´ in Arcadian books;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such´ as sat listening round Apollo's pipe.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When the great deity´, for earth too ripe,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Let his divinity´ o'erflowing die</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In music through the vales of Thessaly."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Equally fine is the varied melody of the young poet's blank verse:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"As when´, upon a trancèd summer night,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Those green-robed senators´ of mighty woods,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tall oaks´, branch-charmèd by the earnest stars,</div>
      <div class='line'>´ Dream', and so dream all night without a stir,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Save from one gradual´ solitary gust</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which comes upon the silence´, and dies off,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As if the ebbing air´ had but one wave;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So came these words and went."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Before adverting to other characters and peculiarities
of English Versification generally, a very few words
may be said in reference to those measures that exceed
the decasyllabic in length. Lines of eleven feet have
never been used in the composition of great or
extended poems. When employed in lyrics and
occasional pieces, the rhythm has usually been thus regulated:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where, cold and unhonour'd, his relics are laid;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sad, silent, and dark be the tears which we shed</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As (the) night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>This rhythmical arrangement seems to be the natural
one, and composes merely the normal line of nine
syllables, with a prefix of two others. Some other
forms of the eleven-syllabled line may be found in
lyrical collections, and more particularly in the works
of Thomas Moore, who, writing to pre-existing music,
has produced specimens of almost every variety of
rhythm of which the English language is capable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The measure of twelve syllables has been employed
by one eminent and true poet in the composition of a
work of importance. The "Polyolbian" of Drayton is
here alluded to. As in the case of other verses of an
even number of syllables, the regular alternation of
short and long seems most suitable to lines of twelve.
Drayton thought so, as the following brief extract
descriptive of Robin Hood will show:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Then, taking them to rest, his merry men and he</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Slept many a summer's night beneath the greenwood tree.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>From wealthy abbots' chests, and churls' abundant store,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What oftentimes he took he shared among the poor;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>No lordly bishop came in lusty Robin's way,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To him before he went, but for his pass must pay;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The widow in distress he graciously relieved,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And remedied the wrongs of many a virgin grieved."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It is superfluous to dwell on accentuation or pauses
here, the line being commonly divided into two even
parts, or, in truth, two six-syllabled lines. The rhythm,
however, is often arranged differently in lyrics, as the
first lines of some of those of Moore will evince:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>"As a beam o'er the face of the waters may glow."</div>
      <div class='line'>"We may roam through this world like a child at a feast."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Like the bright lamp that shone in Kildare's holy fane."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In these instances, two short syllables and a long
one occur in alternation throughout the twelve.
Moore has given other varieties of this measure, as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Through grief and through danger, thy smile hath cheer'd my way;"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>but these are merely capriccios to suit certain music,
and need not occupy our time here. The same poet
has even a line of thirteen syllables.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c006'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"At the mid-hour of night, when stars are weeping I fly."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This measure is a most awkward one, certainly.
The line of fourteen syllables is more natural, and was
used in at least one long piece called "Albion's England,"
by Thomas Warner, a rhymer of the sixteenth
century. A maid is advised whom to love in these terms:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The ploughman's labour hath no end, and he a churl will prove;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The craftsman hath more work on hand than fitteth one to love;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The merchant trafficking abroad, suspects his wife at home;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A youth will play the wanton, and an old will play the mome:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Then choose a shepherd."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This is but the lumbering dodecasyllabic verse rendered
more lumbering still by two fresh feet, it will be
generally allowed. In fact, these lines of twelve and
fourteen feet have only been used effectually as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>"Alexandrines," or single lines introduced to wind up,
or heighten the force of passages, in the heroic or the
octosyllabic measure. Pope ridicules this practice,
though it was a favourite one with Dryden:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>"A needless Alexandrine ends the song,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In Dryden's "Ode to music," the following instances
of the two kinds of Alexandrines occur:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>"Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire."</div>
      <div class='line'>"And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By giving lines of ten, twelve, and fourteen syllables
in succession, as he occasionally does in his translation
of Virgil, Dryden brings passages with artistic skill to
a very noble climax. But the Alexandrine is now
nearly obsolete in our poetry.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most common features and peculiarities of
English Versification have now received a share of
attention. Measure and Rhythm,—Accent and Pause,
have all been duly noticed. There are yet other points,
however, connected with the subject, which merit equal
attention from the student of poetical composition.
Every rule that has been mentioned may be preserved,
and still most inharmonious verse may be the result.
The greatest poets, either from experience or innate
musical taste, adopted additional means to arrive at
perfect versification. Pope points to some of these
in his well-known lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>"The sound must seem an echo to the sense.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The poet, as all will of course see, here exemplifies the
meaning of his lines practically in their structure. The
Greek and Roman writers were quite aware of the
effect of congruous sound and sense. Virgil has
several famous lines constructed on this principle, as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Monstrum, horrendum, informe, ingens cui lumen ademptum."</div>
      <div class='line in6'>(A monster, horrid, formless, gross, and blind.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To give a better idea of the efficient way in which the
poet has roughened the above verse to suit the picture
of a monster, one of his ordinary lines may be quoted:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But it is wrong to call this an ordinary line, since Dr.
Johnson considered it to be the most musical in any
human language. Ovid, again, has made the sense
and sound (and also construction) agree finely
in the following passage:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Sponte sua carmen numeros veniebat ad aptos,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Et quod tentabam dicere versus erat."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Pope has imitated these lines, and applied them to
himself, the signification being simply—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Among our own great bards, Milton stands peculiarly
distinguished for success in the use of this ornament
of verse. The "Allegro" and "Penseroso" exhibit
various exquisite instances.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Swinging slow with sullen roar."</div>
      <div class='line'>"On the light fantastic toe."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Through the high wood echoing shrill."</div>
      <div class='line'>"And the busy hum of men."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Most musical, most melancholy."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Lap me in soft Lydian airs."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the "Paradise Lost," again, there occur many
passages rendered forcible in the extreme by the
adaptation of sound to sense. Thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"Him the Almighty power</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurl'd headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>With hideous ruin and combustion, down</div>
      <div class='line'>To bottomless perdition."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Still more remarkable is the following passage, as
expressive of slow and toilsome travel:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"The fiend</div>
      <div class='line'>O'er bog or steep, through straight, rough, dense, or rare,</div>
      <div class='line'>With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The chief mean of attaining <i>general harmony</i> in verse
is <i>a free and happy distribution of the vowel-sounds</i>.
For producing a <i>special harmony</i>, consonant with
<i>special signification</i>, other rules require to be followed.
But, in the first place, let us look particularly to the
means of rendering verse simply and aggregately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>melodious. It must not be supposed, as many are
apt to do, that even the most illustrious poets considered
it beneath them to attend to such minutiæ as
the distribution of the vowels in their verses. Look at
the grand opening of "Paradise Lost." It is scarcely
conceivable that the remarkable variation of the vowels
there, on which the effect will be found largely to
depend, can have been the result of chance. No one
line almost, it will be seen, gives the same vowel-<i>sound</i>
twice.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Brought death into the world, and all our woe,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Restore us, and regain the heavenly seat,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sing, heavenly Muse."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The following stanza of Leyden was considered by
Scott one of the most musical in the language, and it
is rendered so mainly by its vowel variety:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"How sweetly swell on Jura's heath</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The murmurs of the mountain bee!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How sweetly mourns the writhèd shell,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Of Jura's shore, its parent sea!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A passage from the "Laodamia" of Wordsworth may
be pointed to as an equally striking illustration of the
same rule:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in31'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>"He</div>
      <div class='line'>Spake of heroic arts in graver mood</div>
      <div class='line'>Revived, with finer harmony pursued;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all that is most beauteous—imaged there</div>
      <div class='line'>In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,</div>
      <div class='line'>An ampler ether, a diviner air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fields invested with purpureal glaems;</div>
      <div class='line'>Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Wordsworth, who in truth is the perfect master of this
species of Melody, as the "Excursion" will prove to
all those who look thereinto attentively, has scarcely
once repeated the same exact sound in any two words,
of any one line, in the preceding quotation. One
more passage (from "Lycidas") may be given to undeceive
yet more completely those who have been
want to ascribe the rich Miltonic melody to mere chance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Alas! what boots it with incessant care</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Were it not better done, as others use,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This most melodious passage has often been quoted,
but the source of its melody has not been generally recognised
by ordinary readers. The key which unlocks
the secret has here been given. Let it be applied to
our poetry at large, and it will be found to explain the
effect of many of its grandest and sweetest passages.</p>

<p class='c005'>The proper distribution of the vowels, then, so
effective in the hands of Milton and Wordsworth, may
be decisively viewed as a main help to harmony of
versification generally. But when the poet desires to
make his language express <i>particular</i> meanings by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sounds, he studies more specially, in the first place,
the right disposition of accent and pause, and so advances
partly to his object. Thus Milton, in describing
the fall of Mulciber or Vulcan from heaven, leaves him,
as it were, tumbling and tumbling in the verse, by
a beautiful pause:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"From morn</div>
      <div class='line'>To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,</div>
      <div class='line'>A summer's day."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A similar and not less exquisite pause is made in the
famed passage, otherwise beautiful from variety of
vowels, where, after swelling allusions to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"What resounds</div>
      <div class='line'>In fable or romance of Uther's son</div>
      <div class='line'>Begirt with British and Armoric knights,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all who since, baptized or infidel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jousted in Aspramount or Montalbalm,"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>a dying and most melodious close is attained—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When Charlemain with all his peerage fell</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>By Fontarabia</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Often are similar pauses made effectively at the opening
of lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The schoolboy, wandering through the wood,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To pull the primrose gay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Starts</i>, the new voice of spring to hear,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And imitates thy lay."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"My song, its pinions disarray'd of night,</div>
      <div class='line in3'><i>Droop'd</i>."</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>"The carvèd angels, ever eager eyed,</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Stared</i>."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"Liberty,</div>
      <div class='line'>From heart to heart, from tower to tower, o'er Spain</div>
      <div class='line'>Scattering contagious fire into the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Gleam'd</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Much more striking instances of the effect of laying
marked and compulsory pauses on first syllables might
be adduced, but these, taken by chance, may suffice
as illustrations. Such aids to impressive versifying
must not be overlooked by young poets. The pause
and accent, however, may both be similarly employed
and fixed without the help of positive periods. Thus
Wordsworth, in lines likewise beautiful from vowel-variety:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"What time the hunter's earliest horn is heard,</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Startling</i> the golden hills."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The voice accents the word "startling" naturally;
and mind and ear both own its peculiar aptitude where
it is placed. Not less marked is the force of the same
word in the middle of the Miltonic line:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To hear the lark begin his flight,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And singing <i>startle</i> the dull night."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And again, in the case of the word "start"—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The patriot nymph <i>starts</i> at imagined sounds."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The following are examples of sense brought clearly
out, by placing the pause and accent at different points
of the verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>"My heart <i>aches</i>, and a drowsy numbness pains</div>
      <div class='line in3'>My sense."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Cut mercy with a sharp <i>knife</i> to the bone."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The strong effect of these lines arises from the accent
being thrown on syllables usually short or unaccented
in the decasyllabic verse. This is a common stroke
of art with Milton, when he would lay force on particular
words. Most of our great poets, indeed, knew
and practised the same rule.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much for the effects of the structure of the verse,
and the location of the accent and pause. But the
simple choice of <i>apt diction</i> is still more important to
the art of effective versification, as far as the evolution
of special meanings is concerned. Reference is not
here made to diction that is apt through signification
merely, but such, more particularly, as by its <i>sound</i>
enhances the force of the thoughts or images which it
conveys. In this shape is the congruity of sound and
sense best developed. To the instances given from
Pope and Milton others may now be added, with an
explanation of the artistic rules employed in the case.</p>

<p class='c014'>Observe how finely appropriate is the sound to the
sense in the line:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By the use of the <i>rs</i> here it is, that the very sound of
the surge seems to be brought to the ear; and even
the open vowels at the close give something like the
sense of a great and cold waste of waters beyond the
surge. Equally apt is the impression made by the lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>"The murmurous haunt of flies on summer-eves."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Stubborn'd with iron."</div>
      <div class='line in12'>"A ghostly under-song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among."</div>
      <div class='line'>"The snorting of the war-horse of the storm."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>These are instances in which the roughening effect of
the <i>r</i> is felt to aid the meaning powerfully. The actual
and direct meaning of the words chosen, beyond a
doubt, is by far the most important point in all kinds
of composition; but the art of the poet may be more
or less evinced in his selection of such as have a fit
and correspondent sound. All great poets have recognised
this law. The art, however, must not be too
palpable. Pope, in exemplifying the harsh effect of
the letter <i>r</i>, allowed the art to be too easily seen.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Keats, before quoted, manages the matter more delicately.</p>

<p class='c014'>We refer to the use of the letter <i>r</i> simply in illustration
of a principle of great consequence in poetical
composition. It is also of the widest application.
Not a letter, or combination of letters, in the English
language, is without some peculiar force of sound of
its own, enhancing sense; and above all does this
assertion hold good in respect to the Anglo-Saxon
elements or portions of our vernacular tongue. This
circumstance arises from the fact of the Anglo-Saxon
being a very pure dialect of a primitive language,
the earliest words of which languages are ever mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>descriptions, as far as sound goes, of the acts or objects
implied or spoken of. <i>Hiss</i> and <i>howl</i>, for
instance, are clearly imitative of the noises of hissing
and howling; and thousands of similarly derived
vocables are not less expressive in a kindred way.
Our most eminent national poets, whether taught by
the ear or by experience, have shown themselves well
aware of these things, and have turned to fine account
the Anglo-Saxon constituents of the mother-tongue.
In those languages, again, which have passed through
various shapes since their first invention by man—as
the French, Spanish, and Italian—nearly all traces
of congruous sound and sense have been lost, and
general modulation has taken place of specific expressiveness.
The gain here, which practically rests on
the use of a multiplicity of vowels, cannot be held to
counterbalance the loss. Exquisitely melodious as
are the verses of Tasso and Ariosto, for example, no
one wholly ignorant of Italian could ever even guess
at the meaning of a single line or word from the mere
hearing. The English language stands placed, in
the main, very differently: and happily does it do so,
as far as force, impressiveness, and picturesque beauty
are concerned. No doubt, we have many words
founded on the Latin and its modern derivations; and
these are far from unserviceable, inasmuch as they
lend general harmony to our tongue, spoken and
written. But our special strength of diction comes
from the Anglo-Saxon; and fortunate is it, that that
primitive form of speech still forms the chief constituent
of the national language of Britain.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The reader now understands by what means our
best national poets have striven to render sound and
sense congruous in their verses. It has mainly been,
as said, by the use of Anglo-Saxon words which could
scarcely fail to suit the end well, since they were
actually formed, primarily, upon that very principle.
Much of the power, of course, lies in the consonants
which occur so freely in the language; and yet the
vowels, while essential to the use and force of the
consonants, are not without their individual and
respective kinds and shades of expressiveness. The
<i>o</i>, for instance, has a breadth and weight not pertaining
to the other vowels, as in the last of these two lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>"Some words she spake</div>
      <div class='line'>In solemn tenour and deep organ tone."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The other vowels have also their respective degrees
of depth, lightness, and other qualities. But mere
general harmony only, or chiefly, can be attained by
the use of vowel-sounds unaided by consonants of
particular powers; and it has already been pointed
out, that, to develop that harmony fully, an extensive
variation of the said sounds is the principal thing
required, and has ever been employed by the greatest
poets.</p>

<p class='c014'>With regard to Consonants, there is scarcely one
in the alphabet without some well-marked and special
force of its own. By conjunction with others, or with
vowels, this special force may likewise be modified
vastly, giving rise to numberless varieties of expression,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>or rather expressiveness. The roughening power
of the letter <i>r</i> has been adverted to, and other consonants
may now be noticed, with exemplifications, of
their efficient use in poetry. The consonants are
noticeable for their peculiar powers, at once at the
beginning, in the middle, and at the close of words;
but the present purpose will be best served by taking
them up successively, as initial letters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The consonant <i>b</i>, at the opening of words, has no
very marked force; but it originates many expressive
terms, often finely employed in poetry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"He <i>babbled</i> of green fields."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here the word paints the act to perfection. "<i>Beslubbered</i>
all with tears." "A <i>blubbering</i> boy." "Fire
burn, and caldron <i>bubble</i>." All of these words exemplify
sound and sense clearly combined; and our
poets have also used, with like effect, <i>bawl</i>, <i>brawl</i>,
<i>bray</i>, and many other common terms, beginning with
<i>b</i>. But on the whole, its initial power is not great;
and it is, indeed, rather a soft consonant, like the
labials generally. <i>C</i>, again, sounded as <i>k</i>, has really a
special power, quick, sharp, and cutting, at the commencement
of words, and more particularly when
followed by <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, and aided by apt terminations.
Well did Milton and others of our bards know this
fact, as the subjoined lines may partly show:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<i>Clash'd</i> their sounding shields the din of war."</div>
      <div class='line'>"Till all his limbs do <i>crack</i>."</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>"I <i>cleave</i> with rapid fin the wave."</div>
      <div class='line'>"In one wild havoc <i>crash'd</i>."</div>
      <div class='line'>"The moonbeams <i>crisp</i> the <i>curling</i> surge."</div>
      <div class='line'>"By the howling of the dog."</div>
      <div class='line'>"By the <i>croaking</i> of the frog."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>All these are effective terms, both in the opening and
close. Those who recollect any great actor in "Hamlet,"
must have noticed the splendid emphasis placeable on the words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"What should such fellows as I do,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Crawling</i> betwixt earth and heaven!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The following is most aptly heavy:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Save that a <i>clog</i> doth hang yet at my heel."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And we have here a fine expression, with an equally
good pause:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I plead a pardon for my tale,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And having hemmed and <i>cough'd</i>—begin."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But <i>cough</i> must be pronounced in the old Anglo-Saxon
way, and not as <i>coff</i>. The power of the letter <i>d</i>, at the
commencement of words, is not quick and sharp like
the <i>c</i>, but rather slow and heavy; and this effect is
vastly increased when an <i>r</i> is added. Thus, for
instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<i>Drags</i> its slow length along."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Not all the <i>drowsy</i> syrups of the world."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The <i>dreary</i> melody of bedded reeds."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Snivelling and <i>drivelling</i> folly without end."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>"Good shepherds after shearing <i>drench</i> their sheep."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And <i>dropping</i> melody with every tear."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Such words, too, as <i>drawl</i>, <i>droop</i>, <i>drip</i>, <i>drizzle</i>, <i>drum</i>,
and others, may be, have been used excellently in
poetry. The <i>f</i> is a letter expressive of a light and
rapid action, at least when conjoined with other consonants.
Campbell uses it finely in both ways:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But see! 'mid the <i>fast-flashing</i> lightnings of war.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What steed to the desert <i>flies frantic and far</i>?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The quick action is also signified in <i>flay</i>, <i>flog</i>, <i>fling</i>,
<i>flitter</i>, and other vocables. Coriolanus portrays verbally
the very deed, when he tells how,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Like an eagle in a dovecot, he</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Flutter'd</i> their Volsces in Corioli."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><i>G</i>, by itself, is rather a soft consonant; and, followed
by <i>l</i>, it has also a mild effect, as in the very expressive
words, <i>gleam</i>, <i>glide</i>, <i>glitter</i>, <i>glisten</i>, <i>gloom</i>, and the like.
<i>Gr</i>, again, is singularly heavy and harsh, as in the
succeeding cases:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And <i>grinn'd</i>, terrific, a sardonic look."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<i>Grinn'd</i> horribly a ghastly smile."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<i>Grapple</i> him to thy soul with hooks of steel."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"In came Margaret's <i>grimly</i> ghost."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Of kindred force are <i>grasp</i>, <i>gripe</i>, <i>grope</i>, and others.
<i>Gnash</i> and <i>gnaw</i> have a sort of convulsive twist in
sense, and so should they have in sound, when rightly
pronounced, and after the original mode. By the way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>though <i>grin</i> be a strong word, in its old shape it is
stronger; and that <i>girn</i>, still used in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c005'>All of these specimens of the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary,
and many of a kindred order, have been often
made to tell exquisitely in our national poetry. The
same averment may be made regarding hosts of other
words, differently begun and formed; but we must so
far content ourselves with having shown the principle,
and go over what is to come more quickly. However,
the aspirate <i>h</i> must not be lightly overpassed, having
a striking value in verse. Being pronounced with an
<i>aspiration</i>, it gives a certain energy to almost all words
which it begins, as <i>hack</i>, <i>harsh</i>, <i>hawl</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>hit</i>, <i>hunt</i>,
and the like. To some terms it imparts a sort of
laboriously <i>elevative</i> force. Pope composed the following
line purposely to exemplify this property:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Up the high hill, he heaves a huge round stone."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The merely expiratory force of the <i>h</i> is felt equally in
naming the "heights of heaven" and the "hollows of
hell." Though but half a letter, it is thus potent in
poetry, and is often beautifully turned to account by
Milton, as in the passage, "Him the Almighty power
<i>hurled headlong</i>," and so on.</p>

<p class='c014'>The letter <i>j</i> gives the initiative to many expressive
words, though their expressiveness rests mainly on the
terminations. Such is the case with <i>jar</i>, <i>jerk</i>, <i>jig</i>, <i>jilt</i>,
<i>jog</i>, <i>jostle</i>, <i>jumble</i>, <i>jump</i>. Our comic writers have
used the most of these to good purpose. It is worth
while specially to notice <i>jeer</i>. It would seem as if the
<i>eer</i> was an ending peculiarly fitted to express the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>meaning which <i>jeer</i> bears, since it gives a pretty similar
force to <i>sneer</i>, <i>fleer</i>, <i>leer</i>, <i>peer</i>, <i>queer</i>, and some
others. Sound and sense concur in all these terms.
The <i>k</i> merely gives to words the same power as the
hard <i>c</i>. <i>L</i> has no great force as the initial letter of
words, though it yet possesses so far its own peculiar
expressiveness. That the whole members of the
alphabet do so, indeed, may be very simply proved.
Of the following twelve monosyllables closing in <i>ash</i>,
the different opening letters give a different force, in
respect of sound, to each word, and such as perfectly
accords with the actual and several meanings. The
words are, <i>clash</i>, <i>crash</i>, <i>dash</i>, <i>flash</i>, <i>gnash</i>, <i>lash</i>, <i>mash</i>,
<i>quash</i>, <i>plash</i>, <i>slash</i>, <i>smash</i>, and <i>thrash</i>. The distinction
here may not be great in some instances, but it certainly
is so in the grating <i>crash</i>, the rapid <i>flash</i>, and the
ponderous <i>smash</i>! These points are well worthy the
attention of the student of English Versification—in
truth, of English literature generally.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many expressive words, opening with <i>l</i>, are formed
by apt closes, as <i>lift</i>, <i>lisp</i>, <i>limp</i>, <i>loathe</i>, <i>log</i>, <i>lull</i>, and
<i>lurk</i>. How fine the <i>loll</i> in Shakspeare's line:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The large Achilles, on his press'd bed <i>lolling</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><i>M</i> and <i>n</i>, opening words isolatedly, have little peculiarity
of power, but gain it by continuations and
terminations:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Hell is <i>murky</i>."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To pluck the <i>mangled</i> Tybalt from his shroud."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Thrice the brinded cat hath <i>mew'd</i>."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The <i>matted</i> woods."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>"Thou detestable womb, thou <i>maw</i> of death."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So the two brothers and their <i>murder'd</i> man."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"This hand is <i>moist</i>, my lady."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The <i>muffled</i> drum."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And so on. <i>Neigh</i>, <i>nod</i>, <i>nip</i>, <i>nick</i> and so forth, exemplify
the <i>n</i> sufficiently. There are fewer words of a
very expressive kind opened by <i>p</i>, than by any other
letter which may be followed by other consonants, as
<i>l</i>and <i>r</i>. Nor need <i>q</i> delay our progress. <i>R</i>, however,
as already observed, is one of the most emphatic letters
in the alphabet; and, whether at the beginning, in the
middle, or at the close of words, it gives them a striking
and specific force in enunciation. Rude and rough
power lies in its sound. The monosyllabic verbs
which it commences show well what its original effect
was felt to be. <i>Race</i>, <i>rage</i>, <i>rack</i>, <i>rail</i>, <i>rain</i>, <i>rake</i>,
<i>ramp</i>, <i>range</i>, <i>rant</i>, <i>rate</i>, <i>rave</i>, <i>rash</i>, <i>raze</i>—all these
words have an affinity of meaning, derived from the
<i>ra</i>, though modified by the endings. Followed by
other vowels, the <i>r</i> softens somewhat, as in <i>reach</i>, <i>reap</i>,
<i>ride</i>, <i>rise</i>, and the like; but still there is force of action
implied in the sound. <i>Ring</i>, <i>rip</i>, and <i>rift</i>, may be
styled <i>ear-pictures</i>. It is impossible, by citations, to
give any conception of the extent to which the <i>r</i> has
been used in imparting fitting emphasis to poetry.
Nearly all words, implying terror or horror, rest mainly
on it for their picturesque force. This point, however,
has been already illustrated sufficiently for the present purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>S</i>, by itself, opens many words of mild action, as
<i>sail</i>, <i>sew</i>, <i>sit</i>, <i>soar</i>, and <i>suck</i>. With an additional consonant;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><i>sc</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>sk</i>, <i>sl</i>, <i>sm</i>, <i>sn</i>, <i>sp</i>, <i>sq</i>, <i>st</i>, and <i>su</i> it gives rise
to most potent verbs of action; and still stronger ones
are formed when another consonant is added, as in
the cases of <i>scr</i>, <i>spr</i>, and <i>str</i>. What is chiefly to the
point here, sense and sound are strikingly congruous
in terms of this formation. The initials give force
whatever the endings may be, though these may
modify it largely. Let the reader look well at the following
list. <i>Scald</i>, <i>scalp</i>, <i>scare</i>, <i>scamper</i>, <i>scatter</i>, <i>scoff</i>,
<i>scorn</i>, <i>scowl</i>, <i>scour</i>, <i>scourge</i>, <i>scrape</i>, <i>scrawl</i>, <i>scratch</i>,
<i>scream</i>, <i>screw</i>, <i>scrub</i>, <i>scramble</i>, <i>scraggy</i>, <i>scud</i>; <i>shake</i>,
<i>shape</i>, <i>shave</i>, <i>shift</i>, <i>shine</i>, <i>shirk</i>, <i>shiver</i>, <i>shock</i>, <i>shoot</i>,
<i>shout</i>, <i>shriek</i>, <i>shrill</i>, <i>shrink</i>, <i>shrug</i>, <i>shuffle</i>, <i>shudder</i>,
<i>skate</i>, <i>skim</i>, <i>skiff</i>, <i>skirr</i>; <i>slap</i>, <i>slay</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>slumber</i>, <i>slip</i>,
<i>slit</i>, <i>slink</i>, <i>sling</i>, <i>slow</i>, <i>slough</i>, <i>sluggish</i>, <i>slur</i>, <i>slut</i>, <i>sly</i>;
<i>smash</i>, <i>smite</i>, <i>smile</i>, <i>smooth</i>, <i>smug</i>, <i>smuggle</i>, <i>smother</i>;
<i>snap</i>, <i>snarl</i>, <i>snare</i>, <i>snatch</i>, <i>snib</i>, <i>snip</i>, <i>snub</i>, <i>sneap</i>, <i>snack</i>,
<i>snort</i>, <i>snivel</i>, <i>snell</i>; <i>speed</i>, <i>spit</i>, <i>split</i>, <i>splash</i>, <i>spout</i>,
<i>spring</i>, <i>spur</i>, <i>spurt</i>, <i>spurn</i>, <i>sputter</i>, <i>spy</i>, <i>sprinkle</i>;
<i>squeeze</i>, <i>squall</i>, <i>squeak</i>, <i>squat</i>, <i>squash</i>, <i>squabble</i>, <i>squib</i>;
<i>stab</i>, <i>stamp</i>, <i>stare</i>, <i>start</i>, <i>steal</i>, <i>steam</i>, <i>steep</i>, <i>steer</i>, <i>step</i>,
<i>stem</i>, <i>stick</i>, <i>sting</i>, <i>stir</i>, <i>stoop</i>, <i>storm</i>, <i>stow</i>; <i>strain</i>, <i>strap</i>,
<i>streak</i>, <i>stress</i>, <i>stretch</i>, <i>strew</i>, <i>stride</i>, <i>strike</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>strip</i>,
strive, stroll, strut, stuff, stump, stun, stagger, stammer,
<i>startle</i>, <i>strangle</i>, <i>stutter</i>, <i>struggle</i>, <i>stumble</i>; <i>sway</i>,
<i>sweep</i>, <i>swell</i>, <i>swing</i>, <i>swoop</i>, <i>swirl</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is truly a long roll; but it is one deserving of
all attention from those who are studying the euphony,
or the happy cacophony, of the English vocabulary,
with an eye to poetic composition. Each word here
is, to repeat a somewhat dubious phrase, a positive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>auricular picture. There is variety in sense, but it is
still accompanied by fit variety of sound. And yet a
general similarity of significations exists among the
words formed by <i>s</i> with one or more additional consonants:
while still more akin are the sets of words begun
alike. The whole, collectively, express force, and
for the most part strong force. <i>Scare</i> and <i>scream</i>
imply (in sound and sense) sharp action; <i>shake</i> and
<i>shrink</i>, soft and moderate; <i>skate</i> and <i>skim</i>, quick and
smooth; <i>slip</i> and <i>sling</i>, rapid and easy; <i>smash</i> and
<i>smite</i>, strong and suppressive; <i>snarl</i> and <i>snap</i>, snarling
and snappish; <i>spit</i> and <i>split</i>, slight but decisive;
<i>squeeze</i> and <i>squeak</i>, forcible but petty; <i>stab</i> and <i>stamp</i>,
direct and powerful; <i>strain</i> and <i>strike</i>, full of <i>straining
strength</i>, and with their congeners, the most energetic
of words, in sound and sense, in the language. In
verbs opened by <i>sw</i>, as in <i>sweep</i> and <i>swirl</i>, the <i>s</i> gives
an onward impulse, as it were, and the <i>w</i> renders it so
far rotatory. Leigh Hunt applies the word swirl finely to ships:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"They chase the whistling brine, and swirl into the bay."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Most of the words formed with <i>t</i> as the initial derive
from it no very marked force, and depend for that
quality on the same terminations which have been
noticed as giving force to others. The <i>t</i> need not,
therefore, occupy our space. The <i>w</i> is also weak
alone, but forms terms of some initial pith with the
aspirate <i>h</i> as <i>wheel</i>, <i>whiff</i>, <i>whelm</i>, <i>whip</i>, <i>whirl</i>, <i>whisk</i>,
and <i>whoop</i>. There is a sort of sense of circuitous
motion given by the <i>wh</i>; and, with their well-discriminated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>terminations, the verbs of action which it opens
are very expressive. When <i>wr</i> was pronounced <i>uurr</i>,
the words, <i>wrangle</i>, <i>wrestle</i>, <i>wreath</i>, <i>wring</i>, <i>wrench</i>,
and <i>wrath</i> were words of potency, twisting and convulsive.
But the <i>w</i> is now mute, and their might has departed.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is because much, very much, of the power, the
majesty, and the beauty of English Poetry, as left to
us by our fathers, is traceable to the liberal use of the
Anglo-Saxon elements of our national language, that
the subject has been treated of here so lengthily.
Moreover, there has been evinced of late, it is painful
to add, a growing tendency on the part of many writers
to cultivate Gallicisms, as words of Roman derivation
are rightly named, to a still greater extent than has
yet been done amongst us, and to the repression of our
true native vocabulary. A gain may be made in
this way in respect of general harmony, as before
observed, but it is a gain which never can counterbalance
the loss in point of pith and picturesqueness.
It is not said here, that our greater recent
poets have been the chief deserters of the Anglo-Saxon
tongue. On the contrary, many of them have
shown a full sense of its merits, and have used it
finely. It is a remarkable corroboration, indeed,
of the present argument, that in all their best passages,
they almost uniformly employ the said tongue,
whether consciously or unconsciously. Look at
the following passage of Burns. It has been pronounced
by critics to embody the most powerful picture
in modern poetry.</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>"Coffins stood round like open presses,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>And by some devilish cantrip sleight,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Each in its cauld hand held a light,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>The gray hairs yet stack to the heft."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This passage forms a splendid specimen of almost pure
Anglo-Saxon; and, among the few words of a different
origin, one of the most marked may perhaps be rightly
held a blemish—namely <i>heroic</i>. Like Burns, Wordsworth,
and all those moderns who have studied ear-painting
(if this phrase may be again pardoned) as well
as eye-painting in their verses, have drawn freely on
the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. All young and incipient
versifiers should study their works, and "Go and do
likewise."</p>

<p class='c014'>The general construction of English verse, and the
various rules by which it is rendered melodious,
expressive, and picturesque, having now been explained,
it remains but to indicate, in a few words, the
principal divisions of Poetry common, among us. Epic
verse is held to be the highest description of poetical
composition. The "Iliad" of Homer and "Æneid"
of Virgil have always formed models in this department;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and it is remarkable, but true, that we can
scarcely be said to have one English epic that rises
to their standard, saving "Paradise Lost." Of the
character of an epic, it need but be said here, that the
subject, the diction, and the treatment must all be alike
lofty and sustained. In English, the decasyllabic is
the epic line, sometimes called the Heroic. If we have
so few epics, however, we have many poems of high
note that are usually styled Didactic, from their <i>teaching</i>
great truths. Akenside, Thomson, Cowper,
Rogers, and Campbell wrote such poems, some in
blank verse, others in rhyme. Where rhymed, they
are all written in Couplets, or pairs of lines, rhyming
to one another, in regular succession. Narrative,
Descriptive, and Satiric poems (the several objects of
which may be drawn from these epithets) are important
species of composition, and for the most part
constructed similarly to the Epic and Didactic pieces.
In truth, the ten-syllabled line, in couplets or in blank
verse, though best adapted for grave subjects, has
been employed on almost all themes by English poets.
Nearly the same thing may be said of the octosyllabic
verse, also written commonly in couplets, when used
in long compositions. Many poems, which may be
generally termed Romantic, have likewise been framed
in the eight-syllabled line, though not usually in couplets.</p>

<p class='c014'>The name of Stanzas is bestowed, aggregately, on all
assemblages of lines, exceeding two in number, when
they are arranged continuously. The following is a
stanza of three lines, termed isolatedly a Triplet:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>"Nothing, thou elder brother even to Shade.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thou hadst a being ere the world was made,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And (well fix'd) art alone of ending not afraid."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Stanzas in four lines, called specially Quatrains, are
exemplified in Gray's "Churchyard Elegy." Indeed,
that stanza has long been denominated the Elegiac.
Tennyson's "In Memoriam" is composed in octosyllabic
quatrains. In stanzas of four lines, also, half
the minor poetry in the language is composed. The
general name of "Lyrical" is given to such poetry,
and implies the subjects to be occasional and detached,
and the pieces usually brief. "Songs" come within
the Lyric category. It would be needless to exemplify
a stanza so well known, either in its frequent form of
alternate rhyming lines of eight and eight syllables, or
its yet more common one of eight and six. No continuous
poems of any length or moment have been
written in five-line stanzas, and few in those of six
lines. The latest piece in the latter shape has been
Sir E. L. Bulwer's "King Arthur;" but the stanza is
too like the very famous one called in Italy the <i>ottava
rima</i>, with two lines lopped off and not beneficially.
The "Don Juan" of Byron is composed in this <i>ottava
rima</i>, or eight-lined stanza; but it was borrowed from
the Italians (the real inventors) by William Tennant,
and used in his "Anster Fair," long before Frere or
Byron thought of its appropriation—a circumstance of
which many critics have shown a discreditable ignorance.
It is the best of all stanzas for a light or burlesque
epic, the principle of its construction being—seriousness
in the first six lines, and in the last two a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>mockery of that seriousness. The great poet, however,
can make any stanza great. Shakspeare used the six-line
stanza in his "Venus and Adonis," and that of
seven lines in his "Lucrece."</p>

<p class='c014'>The only other regular English stanza, of high note,
and calling for mention here, is the Spenserian, consisting
of nine lines, the first eight decasyllabic, and
the last an Alexandrine of twelve feet. Many noble
poems have been written in this stanza, from Spenser's
"Fairy Queen" to Byron's "Childe Harold," which
may be viewed as romantic and narrative epics
respectively. It is calculated to convey aptly the
loftiest poetry, though Thomson and Shenstone have
employed it for lighter purposes, in the "Castle of
Indolence" and "Schoolmistress."</p>

<p class='c014'>The sonnet is, in its highest moods, an epic in fourteen
lines; and, as regards its normal structure,
should present but four different rhymes in all. So
Milton wrote it, and so often Wordsworth, <i>facile
principes</i> in this walk of poetic composition; but six
or more rhymes are commonly admitted. The rhymes
of the successive lines stand thus, in the Miltonic
sonnet:—"arms, seize, please, harms, charms, these,
seas, warms, bower, spare, tower, air, power, bare."
In a sonnet, Wordsworth splendidly exemplifies the
sonnet, and tells its uses and its history. ("Scorn not,"
&amp;c. Wordsworth's Miscellaneous Sonnets.)</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ode is a poem of irregular construction, or
rather was so constructed by the Greek bard Pindar,
and after him by Dryden and Collins, his best English
imitators. Wordsworth and Coleridge also wrote fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>odes of late years, and they followed the same irregularities
of composition. Shelley and Keats, however,
produced noble pieces, of the same kind, as those on
"Liberty" and "Melancholy," in which they used a
very free measure, but in orderly stanzas. It would be
out of place to describe at length the plan of the Pindaric
ode—for it had a general plan, though fantastic
in details. The wildest forms of it were styled the
dithyrambic; and impassioned grandeur of sentiment
and diction were its characteristics. Horace, in his
best odes, contented himself with aiming at dignity
and justness of thoughts, and pointedness of expression.
Dryden and Collins, as well as Coleridge
and Shelley, copied and approached the dithyrambic
fervour; while Keats sought but after beauty, and left
us masterpieces in that kind—"alas, too few!"</p>

<p class='c014'>With yet a word on the art of Song-Writing, this
essay may be closed. It well merits a word, and
chiefly because it is an art the most easy in seeming,
and the most difficult in reality, in the entire range of
literary composition. People might easily discern this
truth, if they would but take note how few really great
song-writers have ever flourished among men, at any
time, or in any country. Without forgetting Ramsay,
Hogg, and Cunningham, it may be justly asserted that
Scotland has seen but one such bard, Robert Burns.
Ireland has likewise produced but one, Thomas Moore.
England has given birth to—not one song-writer of the
same high order! Such is the fact; for to such parties
as the Dibdins, Charles Morris, or Haynes Bayly, the
rank of great song-writers cannot be assigned. However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>it is but fair to admit that Moore should be
reckoned as in the main a song-writer of England, his
music only, and occasionally his subjects, being Irish.
His pieces are wholly in the English tongue, and by
the English nation he may so far be claimed. That
numberless individuals have written one or two good
songs, is unquestionable, but the circumstance only
strengthens the present argument. It shows the
difficulty of fitly carrying out and sustaining the
practice of song-writing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Notwithstanding these glaring truths, the young, on
feeling the first prompting of the muse, fly to this
species of composition almost invariably. Now,
whether they do or do not possess the requisite poetical
powers (which is not the point under consideration
here), they certainly take up the said task, almost
always, in total ignorance of the rules of construction
necessary to be observed in song-writing. These are
few, but all-important. After simplicity and concentration
of thought and diction—the first elements in
such compositions—simplicity of grammatical arrangement
stands next in consequence. An inverted expression
is most injurious, and a parenthetic clause
almost uniformly fatal. All forms of complication are
indeed alike hurtful; and even epithets, and adjectives
of every kind, can be employed but sparingly, and
must be most direct and simple. That mode of poetic
diction, which introduces its similitudes by "as the,"
"so the," and "like the," is ruinous in songs. Scarcely
less so are interjections, especially when of some length.
Look how sadly even Wordsworth failed, when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>thought to improve on the old ballad of Helen of Kirkconnel!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Fair Ellen Irvine, <i>when, she sate</i></div>
      <div class='line in3'><i>Upon the braes of Kirtle</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was lovely <i>as a Grecian maid</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in3'><i>Adorn'd with wreaths of myrtle</i>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Compare the effect of this stanza with its parenthetic
clause and its tale-tagged similitude, to that of the old
ballad, so remarkable for its simplicity:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I wish I were where Helen lies;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Night and day on me she cries;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh! that I were where Helen lies,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>On fair Kirkconnel lea."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>*     *     *     *     *     *</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Curst be the head that thought the thought,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Curst be the hand that shot the shot,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When in my arms burd Helen dropt,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And died to succour me."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Even on a reading, the effect of these pieces is
widely different, and would be felt ten times more
were they sung. The best music is ever cast away
on involved phraseology; and herein lies, in fact, the
main reason for simplicity of construction in songs.</p>

<p class='c014'>With these hints on the Art of composing Songs,
most of the suggestions before given respecting the
selection of words of peculiar sounds, may also be kept
in mind. Burns forgot them not. Observe his Wandering
Willie:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Rest, ye wild winds, in the caves of your slumbers,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>How your dread howling a lover alarms."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>But let all the most admired songs of Burns, and of
Moore also, be examined attentively, and the skilful
adaptation of the words to the sentiment, the position
and the purpose will appear clearly. What language,
for example, could be more artistically suited to an
exquisitely soft air than the following by Moore?—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"'Tis the last rose of summer,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Left blooming alone,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>All its lovely companions</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Are faded and gone."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If these lines were written in a dialect utterly strange
to the hearer, he still could not but feel their admirable
melodiousness, so appropriate to the melodious music.
In the case, therefore, of song-writing generally—whether
to known or unknown music—the purpose of
the composition must ever be kept in mind. A song,
if not satisfactorily fitted for vocal utterance, and
intelligible on the hearing of a moment, neither
deserves, nor will receive, popular appreciation and
acceptance. Where true poetry is interfused, as in the
productions of Burns and Moore, then, indeed, is
mastership in the art of song-writing really shown.
Of all classes of writers, the song-writer is perhaps the
most truly an artist.</p>

<p class='c026'>These rules I have, according to the best of my judgment,
endeavoured to extract from the practice, and to frame after
the examples, of the poets that are most celebrated for a
fluent and numerous turn of verse.</p>

<p class='c026'>In the English versification there are two things chiefly to
be considered:</p>

<p class='c027'>1. The verses.</p>

<p class='c027'>2. The several sorts of poems, or composition in verse.</p>

<p class='c027'>But because in the verses there are also two things to be
observed, the structure of the  verse and the rhyme, this
treatise shall be divided into three chapters;</p>

<p class='c027'>I. Of the structure of English verses.</p>

<p class='c027'>II. Of rhyme.</p>

<p class='c027'>III. Of the several sorts of poems, or composition in verse.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>OF THE STRUCTURE OF ENGLISH VERSES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>The structure of our verses, whether blank or in rhyme,
consists in a certain number of syllables; not in feet composed
of long and short syllables, as the verses of the Greeks
and Romans. And though some ingenious persons formerly
puzzled themselves in prescribing rules for the quantity
of English syllables, and, in imitation of the Latins,
composed verses by the measure of spondees, dactyls, &amp;c.,
yet the success of their undertaking has fully evinced the
vainness of their attempt, and given ground to suspect they
had not thoroughly weighed what the genius of our language
would bear, nor reflected that each tongue has its peculiar
beauties, and that what is agreeable and natural to one, is very
often disagreeable, nay, inconsistent with another. But that
design being now wholly exploded, it is sufficient to have
mentioned it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Our verses, then, consist in a certain number of syllables;
but the verses of double rhyme require a syllable more than
those of single rhyme. Thus in a poem whose verses consist
of ten syllables, those of the same poem that are accented
on the last save one, which we call verses of double rhyme,
must have eleven, as may be seen by these verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A Man so various that he seem'd to be</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Not one, but all Mankind's Epitome:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Stiff in Opinion, always in the Wrong,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was ev'ry thing by starts, and nothing long;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But, in the Course of our revolving moon:</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Praising and Railing were his usual Themes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And both, to shew his Judgment, in Extreams.</div>

      <div class='line in1'>That every Man with him was God or Devil."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Where the four verses that are accented on the last save one
have eleven syllables, the others, accented on the last, but ten.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a poem whose verses consist of eight, the double rhymes require nine; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>wants a syllable; for, being accented on the last save one, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>ought to have eleven, as all the verses but two of the preceding
example have. But if we transpose the words thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Of Succour and all needful Comfort void,"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>it then wants nothing of its due measure, because it is accented
on the last syllable.</p>
<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the several sorts of verses; and, first,
of those of ten syllables: of the due observation of the accents,
and of the pause.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>Our poetry admits for the most part but of three sorts of
verses; that is to say, of verses of ten, eight, or seven
syllables. Those of four, six, nine, eleven, twelve, and fourteen,
are generally employed in masks and operas, and in the
stanzas of lyric and Pindaric odes, and we have few entire
poems composed in any of those sort of verses. Those of
twelve and fourteen syllables are frequently inserted in our
poems in heroic verse, and when rightly made use of, carry a
peculiar grace with them. See the next section towards the end.</p>

<p class='c014'>The verses of ten syllables, which are our heroic, are
used in heroic poems, in tragedies, comedies, pastorals,
elegies, and sometimes in burlesque.</p>

<p class='c014'>In these verses two things are chiefly to be considered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. The seat of the accent.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. The pause.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For 'tis not enough that verses have their just number of
syllables; the true harmony of them depends on a due observation
of the accent and pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>The accent is an elevation or a falling of the voice on a
certain syllable of a word.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pause is a rest or stop that is made in pronouncing
the verse, and that divides it, as it were, into two parts; each
of which is called an hemistich, or half-verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this division is not always equal, that is to say, one of
the half-verses does not always contain the same number of
syllables as the other. And this inequality proceeds from
the seat of the accent that is strongest, and prevails most in
the first half-verse. For the pause must be observed at the
end of the word where such accents happen to be, or at the
end of the following word.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, in a verse of ten syllables this accent must be either
on the second, fourth, or sixth; which produces five several
pauses, that is to say, at the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or
seventh syllable of the verse:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>For,</p>

<p class='c014'>When it happens to be on the second, the pause will be
either at the third or fourth.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the third in two manners:</p>

<p class='c014'>1.  When the syllable accented happens to be the last save
one of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"As busy—as intentive Emmets are;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or Cities—whom unlook'd for Sieges scare."—<i>Davenant.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>2.  Or when the accent is on the last of a word, and the
next a monosyllable, whose construction is governed by that
on which the accent is; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Despise it,—and more noble Thoughts pursue."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When the accent falls on the second syllable of the verse,
and the last save two of a word, the pause will be at the
fourth; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"He meditates—his absent Enemy."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When the accent is on the fourth of a verse, the pause will
be either at the same syllable, or at the fifth or sixth.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the same, when the syllable of the accent happens to
be the last of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Such huge Extreams—inhabit thy great Mind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>God-like, unmov'd,—and yet, like Woman, kind."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>At the fifth in two manners:</p>

<p class='c014'>1.  When it happens to be the last save one of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Like bright Aurora—whose refulgent Ray</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Fortells the Feavour—of ensuing Day;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And warns the Shepherd—with his Flocks, retreat</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To leafy Shadows—from the threaten'd Heat."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>2.  Or the last of the word, if the next be a monosyllable
governed by it; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So fresh the Wound is—and the Grief so vast."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At the sixth, when the syllable of the accent happens to be
the last save two of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Those Seeds of Luxury,—Debate, and Pride."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Lastly, when the accent is on the sixth syllable of the verse,
the pause will be either at the same syllable or at the seventh.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same, when the syllable of the accent happens to be
the last of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"She meditates Revenge—resolv'd to die."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At the seventh in two manners:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. When it happens to be the last save one of a word; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Nor when the War is over,—is it Peace."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Mirrors are taught to flatter,—but our Springs."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>2. Or the last of a word, if the following one be a monosyllable
whose construction depends on the preceding word
on which the accent is; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And since he could not save her—with her dy'd."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From all this it appears, that the pause is determined by the
seat of the accent; but if the accents happen to be equally
strong on the second, fourth, and sixth syllable of a verse,
the sense and construction of the words must then guide to
the observation of the pause. For example, in one of the
verses I have cited as an instance of it at the seventh syllable,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Mirrors are taught to flatter, but our Springs."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The accent is as strong on <i>taught</i>, as on the first syllable of
<i>flatter</i>; and if the pause were observed at the fourth
syllable of the verse, it would have nothing disagreeable in
its sound; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Mirrors are taught—to flatter, but our Springs</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Present th' impartial Images of things."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Which though it be no violence to the ear, yet it is to the
sense, and that ought always carefully to be avoided in
reading or in repeating of verses.</p>

<p class='c014'>For this reason it is, that the construction or sense should
never end at a syllable where the pause ought not to be made;
as at the eighth and second in the two following verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Bright Hesper twinkles from afar:—Away</div>
      <div class='line in1'>My Kids!—for you have had a Feast to Day."—<i>Stafford.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Which verses have nothing disagreeable in their structure
but the pause, which in the first of them must be observed
at the eighth syllable, in the second at the second; and so
unequal a division can produce no true harmony. And for
this reason too, the pauses at the third and seventh syllables,
though not wholly to be condemned, ought to be but sparingly
practised.</p>

<p class='c014'>The foregoing rules ought indispensably to be followed in
all our verses of ten syllables; and the observation of them,
like that of right time in music, will produce harmony; the
neglect of them harshness and discord; as appears by the
following verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"None think Rewards render'd worthy their Worth.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And both Lovers, both thy Disciples were."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In which, though the true number of syllables be observed,
yet neither of them have so much as the sound of a verse.
Now their disagreeableness proceeds from the undue seat of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the accent. For example, the first of them accented on the fifth
and seventh syllables; but if we change the words, and
remove the accent to the fourth and sixth, the verse will
become smooth and easy; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"None think Rewards are equal to their Worth."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The harshness of the last of them proceeds from its being
accented on the third syllable, which may be mended thus,
by transposing only one word:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And Lovers both, both thy Disciples were."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In like manner the following verses,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To be massacred, not in Battle slain."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But forc'd, harsh, and uneasy unto all."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Against the Insults of the Wind and Tide."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A second Essay will the Pow'rs appease."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Scythians expert in the Dart and Bow."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>are rough, because the foregoing rules are not observed in their
structure; for example, the first where the pause is at the
fifth syllable, and the accent on the third, is contrary to the
rule, which says, that the accent that determines the pause
must be on the second, fourth, or sixth syllable of the verse;
and to mend that verse we need only place the accent on the
fourth, and then the pause at the fifth will have nothing
disagreeable; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Thus to be murther'd, not in Battle slain."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The second verse is accented on the third syllable, and the
pause is there too; which makes it indeed the thing it expresses,
forced, harsh, and uneasy; it may be mended thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"But forc'd and harsh, uneasy unto all."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The third, fourth, and fifth of those verses have like faults;
for the pauses are at the fifth, and the accent there too;
which is likewise contrary to the foregoing rules. Now they
will be made smooth and flowing, by taking the accent from
the fifth, and removing the seat of the pause; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Against th' Insults both of the Wind and Tide</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A second Tryal will the Pow'rs appease.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With Scythians skilful in the Dart and Bow."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From whence we conclude, that in all verses of ten syllables,
the most prevailing accents ought to be on the second,
fourth, or sixth syllables; for if they are on the third, fifth,
or seventh, the verses will be rough and disagreeable, as has
been proved by the preceding instances.</p>

<p class='c005'>In short, the wrong placing of the accent is as great a fault
in our versification, as false quantity was in that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>ancients; and therefore we ought to take equal care to avoid
it, and endeavour so to dispose the words that they may
create a certain melody in the ear, without labour to the
tongue, or violence to the sense.</p>
<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the other sorts of verses that are used in
our poetry.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>After the verses of ten syllables those of eight are most frequent,
and we have many entire poems composed in them.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the structure of these verses, as well as of those of ten
syllables, we must take care that the most prevailing
accents be neither on the third nor fifth syllables of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>They also require a pause to be observed in pronouncing
them, which is generally at the fourth or fifth syllable; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I'll sing of Heroes,—and of Kings,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In mighty Numbers—mighty things;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Begin, my Muse,—but to the Strings,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To my great Song—rebellious prove,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The Strings will sound—of nought but Love."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The verses of seven syllables, which are called anacreontic,
are most beautiful when the strongest accent is on the
third, and the pause either there or at the fourth; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Fill the Bowl—with rosy Wine,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Round our Temples—Roses twine</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Crown'd with Roses—we contemn</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Gyges' wealthy—Diadem."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The verses of nine and of eleven syllables, are of two sorts;
one is those that are accented upon the last save one, which
are only the verses of double rhyme that belong to those of
eight and ten syllables, of which examples have already been
given. The other of those that are accented on the last
syllable, which are employed only in compositions for music,
and in the lowest sort of burlesque poetry; the disagreeableness
of their measure having wholly excluded them from
grave and serious subjects. They who desire to see examples
of them may find some scattered here and there in our masks
and operas, and in the burlesque writers. I will give but two:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Hylas, O Hylas, why sit we mute?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Now that each Bird saluteth the Spring."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Apart let me view then each Heavenly Fair,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For three at a time there's no Mortal can bear."—<i>Congreve.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The verses of twelve syllables are truly heroic both in their
measure and sound, though we have no entire works composed
in them; and they are so far from being a blemish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the poems they are in, that on the contrary, when rightly employed,
they conduce not a little to the ornament of them;
particularly in the following rencontres:—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. When they conclude an episode in an heroic poem.
Thus Stafford ends his translation of that of Camilla from
the eleventh Æneid with a verse of twelve syllables:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The ling'ring Soul th' unwelcome Doom receives,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, murm'ring with Disdain, the beauteous Body leaves."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>2.  When they conclude a triplet and full sense together; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Millions of op'ning Mouths to Fame belong;                }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And every Mouth is furnish'd with a Tongue;               }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And round with list'ning Ears the flying Plague is hung." }</div>
      <div class='line in48'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And here we may observe by the way, that whenever a
triplet is made use of in an heroic poem, it is a fault not to
close the sense at the end of the triplet, but to continue it
into the next line; as Dryden has done in his translation of
the eleventh Æneid, in these lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Olives crown'd, the Presents they shall bear,    }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A Purple Robe, a Royal Iv'ry Chair,                   }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And all the Marks of Sway that Latian Monarchs wear,  }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Sums of Gold," &amp;c.                                }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And in the seventh Æneid he has committed the like fault:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Then they, whose Mothers, frantick with their Fear, }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In Woods and Wilds the Flags of Bacchus bear,       }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And lead his Dances with dishevell'd Hair,          }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Increase thy Clamours," &amp;c.                         }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But the sense is not confined to the couplet, for the close of
it may fall into the middle of the next verse, that is, the
third, and sometimes farther off, provided the last verse of
the couplet exceed not the number of ten syllables; for then
the sense ought always to conclude with it. Examples of
this are so frequent, that it is needless to give any.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. When they conclude the stanzas of lyric or Pindaric
odes; examples of which are often seen in Dryden, and others.</p>

<p class='c014'>In these verses the pause ought to be at the sixth syllable,
as may be seen in the foregoing examples.</p>

<p class='c014'>We sometimes find it, though very rarely, at the seventh; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"That such a cursed Creature—lives so long a Space."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When it is at the fourth, the verse will be rough and
hobbling; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>"And Midwife Time—the ripen'd Plot to Murther brought."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The Prince pursu'd,—and march'd along with great equal Pace."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the last of which it is very apparent, that if the sense
and construction would allow us to make the pause at the
sixth syllable,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The Prince pursu'd, and march'd—along with equal pace,"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>the verse would be much more flowing and easy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The verses of fourteen syllables are less frequent than those
of twelve; they are likewise inserted in heroic poems, &amp;c.,
and are agreeable enough when they conclude a triplet and
sense, and follow a verse of twelve; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"For Thee the Land in fragrant Flowers is drest;                }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy Breast,        }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Heav'n itself with more serene and purer Light is blest."  }</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But if they follow one of ten syllables, the inequality of the
measure renders them less agreeable; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"While all thy Province, Nature, I survey,                         }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And sing to Memmius an immortal Lay                               }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of Heav'n and Earth; and everywhere thy wonderous Pow'r display." }</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Especially if it be the last of a couplet only; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Court-Informer's Haunts, and Royal Spies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles Truth</div>
      <div class='line'>with Lies."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But this is only in heroics; for in their Pindarics and
lyrics, verses of twelve or fourteen syllables are frequently
and gracefully placed, not only after those of twelve or ten,
but of any other number of syllables whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c005'>The verses of four and six syllables have nothing worth
observing, and therefore I shall content myself with having
made mention of them. They are, as I said before, used
only in operas and masks, and in lyric and Pindaric odes.
Take one example of them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"To rule by love,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To shed no Blood,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>May be extoll'd above;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But here below,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Let Princes know,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>'Tis fatal to be good."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Several rules conducing to the beauty of our
versification.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>Our poetry being very much polished and refined since the
days of Chaucer, Spenser, and the other ancient poets, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>rules which they neglected, and that conduce very much to the
ornaments of it, have been practised by the best of the moderns.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first is to avoid as much as possible the concourse of
vowels, which occasions a certain ill-sounding gaping, called
by the Latins <i>hiatus</i>; and which they thought so disagreeable
to the ear, that, to avoid it, whenever a word ended in
a vowel, and the next began with one, they never, even in
prose, sounded the vowel of the first word, but lost it in the
pronunciation; and it is a fault in our poets not to do the
like, whenever our language will admit of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>For this reason the <i>e</i> of the particle the ought always to
be cut off before the words that begin with a vowel; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With weeping Eyes she heard th' unwelcome News."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And it is a fault to make the and the first syllable of the
following word two distinct syllables, as in this,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Restrain'd a while by the unwelcome Night."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A second sort of hiatus, and that ought no less to be avoided,
is when a word that ends in a vowel that cannot be cut off,
is placed before one that begins with the same vowel, or one
that has the like sound; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Should thy Iambicks swell into a Book."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The second rule is, to contract the two last syllables of the
preterperfect tenses of all the verbs that will admit of it;
which are all the regular verbs whatsoever, except only
those ending in <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>, and <i>de</i> or <i>te</i>. And it is a fault to
make amazed of three syllables, and loved of two, instead of
amazed of two, and loved of one.</p>

<p class='c014'>And the second person of the present and preterperfect
tenses of all verbs ought to be contracted in like manner; as
thou lov'st, for thou lovest, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>The third rule is, not to make use of several words in a
verse that begin with the same letter; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The Court he knew to Steer in Storms of State,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He in these Miracles Design discern'd."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Yet we find an instance of such a verse in Dryden's translation
of the first pastoral of Virgil:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Till then a helpless, hopeless, homely swain."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Which I am persuaded he left not thus through negligence or
inadvertency, but with design to paint in the number and sound
of the words the thing he described—a shepherd in whom</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Nec spes libertatis erat, nec cura peculi."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Now how far the sound of the <i>h</i> aspirate, with which three
feet of that verse begin, expresses the despair of the swain,
let the judicious judge. I have taken notice of it only to say,
that it is a great beauty in poetry, when the words and
numbers are so disposed, as by their order and sound to represent
the things described.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fourth is, to avoid ending a verse by an adjective
whose substantive begins the following; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Some lost their quiet Rivals, some their kind</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Parents," &amp;c.—<i>Davenant.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or, by a preposition when the case it governs begins the
verse that follows; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The daily less'ning of our life, shews by</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A little dying, how outright to dye."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The fifth is, to avoid the frequent use of words of many
syllables, which are proper enough in prose, but come not
into verse without a certain violence altogether disagreeable;
particularly those whose accent is on the fourth syllable from
the last, as undutifulness.</p>
<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Doubts concerning the number of syllables of
certain words.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>There is no language whatsoever that so often joins
several vowels together to make diphthongs of them, as ours;
this appears in our having several composed of three different
vowels, as <i>eau</i> and <i>eou</i> in beauteous, <i>iou</i> in glorious, <i>uai</i>
in acquaint, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now from hence may arise some difficulties concerning the
true pronunciation of those vowels, whether they ought to be
founded separately in two syllables, or jointly in one.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ancient poets made them sometimes of two syllables,
sometimes but of one, as the measure of their verse required;
but they are now become to be but of one, and it is a fault
to make them of two: from whence we may draw this
general rule:—That whenever one syllable of a word ends
in a vowel, and the next begins with one, provided the
first of those syllables be not that on which the word is
accented, those two syllables ought in verse to be contracted
and made but one.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus beauteous is but two syllables, victorious but three;
and it is a fault in Dryden to make it four, as he has done in
this verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Your arms are on the Rhine victorious."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>To prove that this verse wants a syllable of its due measure,
we need but add one to it; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Your arms are on the Rhine victorious now."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Where, though the syllable <i>now</i> be added to the verse, it has
no more than its due number of syllables; which plainly
proves it wanted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But if the accent be upon the first of these syllables, they
cannot be contracted to make a diphthong, but must be computed
as two distinct syllables: thus poet, lion, quiet, and
the like, must always be used as two syllables; poetry, and
the like, as three. And it is a fault to make riot, for example,
one syllable, as Milton has done in this verse,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Their Riot ascends above the lofty Tow'rs."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The same poet has in another place made use of a like word
twice in one verse, and made it two syllables each time;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Ruin upon Ruin, Rout on Rout."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And any ear may discover that this last verse has its true
measure, the other not.</p>

<p class='c014'>But there are some words that may be excepted; as diamond,
violet, violent, diadem, hyacinth, and perhaps some
others, which, though they are accented upon the first vowel,
are sometimes used but as two syllables; as in the following
verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"From Diamond Quarries hewn, and Rocks of Gold."—<i>Milton.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Poppies, Daffadils, and Violets join'd."—<i>Tate.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With vain, but violent force their Darts they flung."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"His Ephod, Mitre, well-cut Diadem on."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"My blushing Hyacinths, and my Bays I keep."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes as three; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A Mount of Rocky Diamond did rise."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Hence the blue Violet and blushing Rose."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And set soft Hyacinths of Iron blue."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When they are used but as two syllables they suffer an
elision of one of their vowels, and are generally written thus,
di'mond, vi'let, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>This contraction is not always made of syllables of the
same word only; for the particle <i>a</i> being placed after a word
that ends in a vowel, will sometimes admit of the like contraction;
for example, after the word many; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Tho' many a victim from my Folds was bought,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And many a Cheese to Country Markets brought."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"They many a Trophy gain'd with many a Wound."—<i>Davenant.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>After <i>to</i>; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Can he to a Friend, to a Son so bloody grow?"—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After <i>they</i>; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"From thee, their long-known King, they a King desire."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After <i>by</i>; as,</p>

      <div class='line'>"When we by a foolish Figure say."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And perhaps after some others.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are also other words whose syllables are sometimes
contracted, sometimes not; as bower, heaven, prayer, nigher,
towards, and many more of the like nature, but they generally
ought to be used but as one syllable; and then they suffer an
elision of the vowel that precedes their final consonant, and
ought to be written thus, bow'r, heav'n, pray'r, nigh'r, tow'rds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The termination <i>ism</i> is always used but as one syllable; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Where grisly Schism and raging Strife appear."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
      <div class='line'>"And Rheumatisms I send to rack the Joynts."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And, indeed, considering that it has but one vowel, it may
seem absurd to assert that it ought to be reckoned two syllables;
yet in my opinion those verses seem to have a syllable
more than their due measure, and would run better if we took
one from them; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Where grisly Schism, raging Strife appear,"</div>
      <div class='line'>"I Rheumatisms send to rack the Joynts."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Yet this opinion being contrary to the constant practice of
our poets, I shall not presume to advance it as a rule for
others to follow, but leave it to be decided by such as are
better judges of poetical numbers.</p>

<p class='c014'>The like may be said of the terminations <i>asm</i> and <i>osm</i>.</p>
<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section V.</span>—<i>Of the elisions that are allowed in our
versification.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>In verses consisting only of a certain number of syllables,
nothing can be of more ease, or greater use to poets, than the
retaining or cutting off a syllable from a verse, according as
the measure of it requires; and therefore it is requisite to
treat of the elisions that are allowable in our poetry, some
of which have been already taken notice of in the preceding section.</p>

<p class='c014'>By elision I mean the cutting off one or more letters from
a word, whereby two syllables come to be contracted into
one, or the taking away an entire syllable. Now when in a
word of more than two syllables, which is accented on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>last save two, the liquid <i>r</i> happens to be between two
vowels, that which precedes the liquid admits of an elision.
Of this nature are many words in <i>ance</i>, <i>ence</i>, <i>ent</i>, <i>er</i>, <i>ous</i>, and
<i>ry</i>; as temperance, preference, different, flatterer, amorous,
victory: which are words of three syllables, and often used
as such in verse; but they may be also contracted into two by
cutting off the vowel that precedes the liquid, as temp'rance,
pref'rence, diff'rent, flatt'rer, am'rous, vict'ry. The like elision
is sometimes used when any of the other liquids <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, or
<i>n</i>, happen to be between two vowels in words accented like
the former; as fabulous, enemy, mariner, which may be
contracted fab'lous, en'my, mar'ner. But this is not so frequent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Observe, that I said accented on the last save two; for if
the word be accented on the last save one, that is to say, on
the vowel that precedes the liquid, that vowel may not be
cut off. And therefore it is a fault to make, for example,
sonorous two syllables, as in this verse;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"With Son'rous Metals wak'd the drowsy Day."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Which always ought to be three, as in this,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Sonorous Metals blowing martial sounds."—<i>Milton.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In like manner, whenever the letter <i>s</i> happens to be between
two vowels in words of three syllables, accented on the first,
one of the vowels may be cut off; as pris'ner, bus'ness, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or the letter <i>c</i> when it is sounded like <i>s</i>; that is to say,
whenever it precedes the vowel <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>; as med'cine for medicine.
Or <i>v</i> consonant, as cov'nant for covenant.</p>

<p class='c005'>To these may be added the gerunds of all verbs whose
infinities end in any of the liquids, preceded by a vowel or
a diphthong, and that are accented on the last save one; for
the gerunds being formed by adding the syllable <i>ing</i> to the
infinitive, the liquid that was their final letter comes thereby
to be between two vowels; and the accent that was on the last
save one of the infinitive, comes to be on the last save two of
the gerunds: and therefore the vowel or diphthong that precedes
the liquid may be cut off; by means whereof the
gerund of three syllables comes to be but of two; as from
travel, travelling, or trav'ling; from endeavour, endeavouring,
or endeav'ring, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>But if the accent be on the last syllable of such a verb, its
gerund will not suffer such an elision. Thus the gerund of
devour must always be three syllables, devouring, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>dev'ring; because all derivatives still retain the accent of
their primitives, that is, on the same syllable; and the accent
always obliges the syllable on which it is to remain entire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gerunds of the verbs in <i>ow</i>, accented on the last save
two, suffer an elision of the <i>o</i> that precedes the <i>w</i>; as foll'wing, wall'wing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The particle <i>it</i> admits of an elision of its vowel before it
was, were, will, would; as 'tis, 'twas, 'twere, 'twill, 'twould,
for it is, it was, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>It likewise sometimes suffers the like elision when placed
after a word that ends in a vowel; as by't for by it, do't for
do it; or that ends in a consonant after which the letter <i>t</i> can
be pronounced; as was't for was it, in't for in it, and the like.
But this is not so frequent in heroic verse.</p>

<p class='c005'>The particle <i>is</i> may lose its <i>i</i> after any word that ends in a
vowel, or in any of the consonants after which the letter <i>s</i>
may be sounded; as she's for she is, the air's for the air is, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>To (sign of the infinitive mood) may lose its <i>o</i> before any
verb that begins with a vowel; as t'maze, t'undo, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>To (sign of the dative case) may likewise lose its <i>o</i> before
any noun that begins with a vowel; as t'air, t'every, &amp;c. But
this elision is not so allowable as the former.</p>

<p class='c005'>Are may lose its <i>a</i> after the pronouns personal, we, you,
they; as we're, you're, they're. And thus it is that this
elision ought to be made, and not, as some do, by cutting off
the final vowels of the pronouns personal, w'are, y'are, th'are.</p>

<p class='c005'>Will and would may lose all their first letters, and retain
only their final one, after any of the pronouns personal; as
I'll for I will, he'd for he would; or after who, who'll for who
will, who'd for who would.</p>

<p class='c005'>Have may lose its two first letters after I, you, we, they;
as I've, you've, we've, they've.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not, its two first letters after can; as can't for cannot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Am, its <i>a</i> after <i>i</i>; I'm for I am.</p>

<p class='c005'>Us, its <i>u</i> after let; let's for let us.</p>

<p class='c005'>Taken, its <i>k</i>, ta'en; for so it ought to be written, not ta'ne.</p>

<p class='c005'>Heaven, seven, even, eleven, and the participles driven,
given, thriven, and their compounds, may lose their last vowel;
as heav'n, forgiv'n, &amp;c. See the foregoing section.</p>

<p class='c005'>To these may be added, bow'r, pow'r, flow'r, tow'r, show'r,
for bower, tower, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>Never, ever, over, may lose their <i>v</i>, and are contracted
thus, ne'er, e'er, o'er.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Some words admit of an elision of their first syllable; as
'tween, 'twixt, 'mong, 'mongst, 'gainst, 'bove, 'cause, 'fore, for
between, betwixt, among, amongst, against, above, because,
before, and some others that may be observed in reading our
poets.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have already, in the third section of this chapter, spoken
of the elision of the <i>e</i> of the particle the before vowels; but it
is requisite likewise to take notice, that it sometimes loses its
vowel before a word that begins with a consonant, and then
its two remaining letters are joined to the preceding word;
as to th' wall for to the wall, by th' wall for by the wall, &amp;c.,
but this is scarcely allowable in heroic poetry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The particles in, of, and on, sometimes lose their consonants,
and are joined to the particle the in like manner, as i'th',
o'th', for in the, of the.</p>

<p class='c005'>In some of our poets we find the pronoun his loses its two
first letters after any word that ends in a vowel; as to's, by's,
&amp;c., for to his, by his, &amp;c.; or after many words that end in
a consonant, after which the letter <i>s</i> can be pronounced; as
in's, for's, for in his, for his, &amp;c. This is frequent in Cowley,
who often takes too great liberty in his contractions; as
t'your for to your, t'which for to which, and many others; in
which we must be cautious in following his example, but the
contracting of the pronoun his in the manner I mentioned is
not wholly to be condemned.</p>

<p class='c005'>We sometimes find the word who contracted before words
that begin with a vowel; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Wh' expose to Scorn and Hate both them and it."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And the preposition in like manner; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"B' unequal Fate and Providence's Crime."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
      <div class='line'>"Well did he know how Palms b' Oppression speed."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And the pronouns personal, he, she, they, we; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Timely h' obeys her wise Advice, and strait</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To unjust Force sh' opposes just Deceit."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Themselves at first against themselves th' excite."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Shame and Woe to us, if w' our Wealth obey."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But these and the like contractions are very rare in our
most correct poets, and indeed ought wholly to be avoided,
for 'tis a general rule that no vowel can be cut off before
another, when it cannot be sunk in the pronunciation of it:
and therefore we ought to take care never to place a word
that begins with a vowel after a word that ends in one (mute
<i>e</i> only excepted), unless the final vowel of the former can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>lost in its pronunciation, for to leave two vowels opening on
each other, causes a very disagreeable hiatus. Whenever
therefore a vowel ends a word, the next ought to begin with
a consonant, or what is equivalent to it; as our <i>w</i> and <i>h</i>
aspirate plainly are.</p>

<p class='c005'>For which reason it is a fault in some of our poets to cut
off the <i>e</i> of the particle the; for example, before a word that
begins by an <i>h</i> aspirate; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And th' hasty Troops march'd loud and cheerful down."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But if the <i>h</i> aspirate be followed by another <i>e</i>, that of
the particle the may be cut off; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Th' Heroick Prince's Courage or his love."—<i>Waller.</i></div>

of two words. I say of sound, not of letters; for the
office of rhyme being to content and please the ear, and not
the eye, the sound only is to be regarded, not the writing:
thus maid and persuade, laugh and quaff, though they differ
in writing, rhyme very well: but plough and cough, though
their terminations are written alike, rhyme not at all.</p>

<p class='c005'>In our versification we may observe three several sorts of
rhyme: single, double, and treble.</p>

<p class='c005'>The single rhyme is of two sorts: one, of the words that are
accented on the last syllable; another, of those that have
their accent on the last save two.</p>

<p class='c005'>The words accented on the last syllable, if they end in a
consonant, or mute <i>e</i>, oblige the rhyme to begin at the vowel
that precedes their last consonant, and to continue to the end
of the word. In a consonant; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Here might be seen, the Beauty, Wealth, and Wit,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Prowess, to the Pow'r of Love submit."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In mute <i>e</i>; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A Spark of Virtue, by the deepest Shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sad Adversity, is fairer made."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But if a diphthong precede the last consonant the rhyme must
begin at that vowel of it whose sound most prevails; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Next to the Pow'r of making Tempest cease,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was in that storm to have so calm a Peace."</div>
      <div class='c008'>—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>If the words accented on the last syllable end in any of the
vowels, except mute <i>e</i>, or in a diphthong, the rhyme is made
only to that vowel or diphthong. To the vowel; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So wing'd with Praise we penetrate the Sky,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Teach Clouds and Stars to praise him as we fly."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To the diphthong; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So hungry Wolves, tho' greedy of their Prey,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Stop when they find a Lion in the Way."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The other sort of single rhyme is of the words that have
their accent on the last syllable save two, and these rhyme
to the other in the same manner as the former; that is to
say, if they end in any of the vowels, except mute <i>e</i>, the
rhyme is made only to that vowel; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So seems to speak the youthful Deity;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Voice, Colour, Hair, and all like Mercury."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But if they end in a consonant or mute <i>e</i>, the rhyme must
begin at the vowel that precedes that consonant, and continue
to the end of the word; as has been shewn by the former examples.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we must take notice, that all the words that are
accented on the last save two, will rhyme not only to one
another, but also to all the words whose terminations have
the same sound, though they are accented on the last syllable.
Thus tenderness rhymes not only to poetess, wretchedness,
and the like, that are accented on the last save two, but
also to confess, excess, &amp;c., that are accented on the last; as,</p>

<p class='c005'>"Thou art my Father now these Words confess
 That Name, and that indulgent Tenderness."—<i>Dryden.</i></p>
<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of double and treble rhyme.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>All words that are accented on the last save one, require
rhyme to begin at the vowel of that syllable, and to continue
to the end of the word; and this is what we call double rhyme; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Then all for Women, Painting, Rhyming, Drinking,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Besides ten thousands Freaks that dy'd in Thinking."—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But it is convenient to take notice, that the ancient poets
did not always observe this rule, and took care only that the
last syllables of the words should be alike in sound without
any regard to the seat of the accent. Thus nation and affection,
tenderness and hapless, villany and gentry, follow and
willow, and the like, were allowed as rhymes to each other
in the days of Chaucer, Spenser, and the rest of the ancients;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>but this is now become a fault in our versification; and these
two verses of Cowley rhyme not at all,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A dear and lively Brown was Merab's Dye;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such as the proudest Colours might envy."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nor these of Dryden,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Thus Air was void of Light, and Earth unstable,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Because we may not place an accent on the last syllable of
envy, nor on the last save one of unnavigable; which nevertheless
we must be obliged to do, if we make the first of
them rhyme to dye, the last to unstable.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we may observe, that in burlesque poetry it is permitted
to place an accent upon a syllable that naturally has none; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"When Pulpit, Drum Ecclesiastick,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Was beat with Fist instead of a Stick."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Where, unless we pronounce the particle <i>a</i> with a strong accent
upon it, and make it sound like the vowel <i>a</i> in the last
syllable but one of ecclesiastic, the verse will lose all its beauty
and rhyme. But this is allowable in burlesque poetry only.</p>

<p class='c014'>Observe that these double rhymes may be composed of two
several words, provided the accent be on the last syllable of
the first of them; as these verses of Cowley, speaking of gold,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"A Curse on him who did refine it,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A Curse on him who first did coin it."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or some of the verses may end in an entire word, and the
rhyme to it be composed of several; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Tho' stor'd with Deletery Med'cines</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which whosoever took is dead since."—<i>Hudibras.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The treble rhyme is very seldom used, and ought wholly
to be exploded from serious subjects; for it has a certain
flatness unworthy the gravity required in heroic verse. In
which Dryden was of opinion, that even the double rhymes
ought very cautiously to find place; and in all his translations
of Virgil he has made use of none, except only in such
words as admit of a contraction, and therefore cannot properly
be said to be double rhymes; as giv'n, driv'n, tow'r,
pow'r, and the like. And indeed, considering their measure
is indifferent from that of a heroic verse, which consists but of
ten syllables, they ought not to be too frequently used in
heroic poems; but they are very graceful in the lyric, to
which, as well as to the burlesque, those rhymes more
properly belong.</p>
<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Further instructions concerning rhyme.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>The consonants that precede the vowels where the rhyme
begins, must be different in sound, and not the same; for
then the rhyme will be too perfect; as light, delight; vice,
advice, and the like; for though such rhymes were allowable
in the days of Spenser and the other old poets, they are not
so now, nor can there be any music in one single note.
Cowley himself owns, that they ought not to be allowed
except in Pindaric odes, which is a sort of free poetry, and
there too very sparingly and not without a third rhyme to
answer to both; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"In barren Age wild and inglorious lye,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And boast of past Fertility,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The poor relief of present Poverty."—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Where the words fertility and poverty rhyme very well to the
last word of the first verse, lye; but cannot rhyme to each
other, because the consonants that precede the last vowels
are the same, both in writing and sound.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this is yet less allowable, if the accent be on the last
syllable of the rhyme; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Her Language melts Omnipotence, arrests</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His hand, and thence the vengeful Light'ning wrests."—<i>Blac.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From hence it follows, that a word cannot rhyme to itself
though the signification be different; as, he leaves to the
leaves, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor the words that differ both in writing and sense, if
they have the same sound, as maid and made, prey and pray,
to bow and a bough; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"How gaudy Fate may be in Presents sent,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And creep insensible by Touch or Scent."—<i>Oldham.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nor a compound to its simple; as move to remove, taught
to untaught, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor the compounds of the same words to one another, as
disprove to approve, and the like. All which proceeds from
what I said before, viz., that the consonants that precede
the vowels where the rhyme begins, must not be the same in
sound, but different. In all which we vary from our neighbours;
for neither the French, Italians, nor Spaniards, will
allow, that a rhyme can be too perfect; and we meet with
frequent examples in their poetry, where not only the compounds
rhyme to their simples, and to themselves, but even
where words written and pronounced exactly alike, provided
they have a different signification, are made use of as rhymes
to another. But this is not permitted in our poetry.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>We must take care not to place a word at the middle of a
verse that rhymes to the last word of it; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"So young in show, as if he still should grow."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But this fault is still more inexcusable, if the second verse
rhyme to the middle and end of the first; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught,</div>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF POEMS, OR COMPOSITION IN VERSE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>All our poems may be divided into two sorts: the first
are those composed in couplets; the second those that are
composed in stanzas, consisting of several verses.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the poems composed in couplets.</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>In the poems composed in couplets, the rhymes follow one
another, and end at each couplet; that is to say, the second
verse rhymes to the first, the fourth to the third, the sixth to
the fifth, and in like manner to the end of the poem.</p>

<p class='c014'>The verses employed in this sort of poems are either verses
of ten syllables; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Oh! could I flow like thee, and make thy Stream</div>
      <div class='line in1'>My great Example, as it is my Theme;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tho' dark yet clear; tho' gentle, yet not dull;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Strong without Rage; without o'erflowing full."—<i>Denham.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or of eight; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"O fairest Piece of well-form'd Earth,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Why urge you thus your haughty Birth?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The Pow'r, which you have o'er us lies,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Not in your Race, but in your Eyes.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Smile but on me, and you shall scorn</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Henceforth to be of Princes born:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I can describe the shady Grove,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where your lov'd Mother slept with Jove:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And yet excuse the faultless Dame,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Caught with her Spouse's Shape and Name:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thy matchless Form will credit bring,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To all the Wonders I shall sing."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Or of seven; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Phillis, why should we delay</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Pleasures shorter than the Day?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Could we, which we never can,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Stretch our Lives beyond their Span,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Beauty like a Shadow flies,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Love has swifter Wings than Time."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But the second verse of the couplet does not always contain
a like number of syllables with the first; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"What shall I do to be for ever known,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And make the Age to come my own?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I shall like Beast and common People die,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Unless you write my Elegy."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the poems composed in stanzas;<br />and first, of the stanzas consisting of three and of four verses.</i></h3>

<p class='c030'>In the poems composed of stanzas, each stanza contains a
certain number of verses, consisting for the most part of a different
number of syllables; and a poem that consists of several
stanzas we generally call an ode; and this is lyric poetry.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we must not forget to observe, that our ancient poets
frequently made use of intermixed rhyme in their heroic
poems, which they disposed into stanzas and cantos. Thus
the "Troilus and Cressida" of Chaucer is composed in
stanzas consisting of seven verses; the "Fairy Queen" of
Spenser in stanzas of nine, &amp;c.; and this they took from the
Italians, whose heroic poems generally consist in stanzas of
eight. But this is now wholly laid aside, and Davenant,
who composed his "Gondibert" in stanzas of four verses in
alternate rhyme, was the last that followed their example of
intermingling rhymes in heroic poetry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The stanzas employed in our poetry cannot consist of less
than three, and are seldom of more than twelve verses, except
in Pindaric odes, where the stanzas are different from one
another in number of verses, as shall be shown.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to treat of all the different stanzas that are employed
or may be admitted in our poetry would be a labour no less
tedious than useless; it being easy to demonstrate that
they may be varied almost to an infinity, that would be different
from one another, either in the number of the verses
of each stanza, or in the number of the syllables of each
verse; or, lastly, in the various intermingling of the rhyme.
I shall therefore confine myself to mention only such as are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>most frequently used by the best of our modern poets. And
first of the stanzas consisting of three verses.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the stanzas of three verses, or triplets, the verses of
each stanza rhyme to one another, and are either heroic; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Nothing, thou elder Brother even to Shade!                      }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thou hadst a Being ere the World was made,                      }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And (well fix'd) art alone of ending not afraid."—<i>Rochester.</i> }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or else they consist of eight syllables; as these of Waller,
"Of a fair lady playing with a snake,"</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Strange that such Horror and such Grace }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Should dwell together in one Place,     }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A Fairy's Arm, an Angel's Face."        }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nor do the verses of the stanzas always contain a like number
of syllables; for the first and third may have ten, the
second but eight; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Men without Love have oft so cunning grown,    }</div>
      <div class='line in3'>That something like it they have shown,      }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But none who had it, ever seem'd t'have none." }</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Love's of a strangely open, simple Kind,                     }</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Can no Arts or Disguises find;                             }</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But thinks none sees it, 'cause itself is blind."—<i>Cowley.</i> }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the stanzas of four verses, the rhyme may be intermixed
in two different manners; for either the first and third verse
may rhyme to each other, and by consequence the second
and fourth, and this is called alternate rhyme; or the first and
fourth may rhyme, and by consequence the second and third.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there are some poems, in stanzas of four verses, where
the rhymes follow one another, and the verses differ in number
of syllables only; as in Cowley's "Hymn to the Light,"
which begins thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"First-born of Chaos! who so fair didst come</div>
      <div class='line in3'>From the old Negro's darksome Womb:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which, when it saw the lovely Child,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The melancholy Mass put on kind Looks and smil'd."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But these stanzas are generally in alternate rhyme, and
the verses either consist of ten syllables; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"She ne'er saw Courts, but Courts could have undone</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With untaught Looks and an unpractis'd Heart:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Her nets the most prepar'd could never shun;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For Nature spread them in the scorn of Art."—<i>Davenant.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or of eight; as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Had Echo with so sweet a Grace,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Narcissus loud Complaint return'd:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Not for Reflection of his Face,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But of his Voice the Boy had burn'd."—<i>Waller.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Or of ten and eight, that is to say, the first and third of ten,
the second and fourth of eight; as,</p>

<p class='c031'>The stanzas of six verses are generally only one of the

of ten syllables, each in alternate rhyme.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Of the stanzas of eight verses.</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>I have already said that the Italians compose their heroic
poems in stanzas of eight verses, where the rhyme is disposed
as follows: The first, third, and fifth verses rhyme to one
another, and the second, fourth, and sixth, the two last
always rhyme to each other. Now our translators of their
heroic poems have observed the same stanza and disposition
of rhyme, of which take the following example from Fairfax's
translation of Tasso's "Goffredo," cant. 1, stan. 3,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section V.</span>—<i>Of the stanzas of ten and twelve verses.</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>The stanzas of ten and twelve verses are seldom employed
in our poetry, it being very difficult to confine ourselves to
a certain disposition of rhyme, and measure of verse, for so
many lines together; for which reason those of four, six, and
eight verses are the most frequent. However, we sometimes
find some of ten and twelve; as in Cowley's ode, which he
calls "Verses Lost upon a Wager," where the rhymes follow
one another; but the verses differ in the number of syllables.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"As soon hereafter will I Wagers lay</div>

      <div class='line in1'>A Tongue so blest by Nature and by Art,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That never yet it spoke, but gain'd a heart.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The same poet furnishes us with an example of a stanza of
twelve verses in the ode he calls "The Prophet," where the
rhymes are observed in the same manner as in the former examples.</p>

<p class='c030'><i>number of verses.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>We have also stanzas that consist of odd numbers of
verses, as of five, seven, nine, and eleven; in all which it of
necessity follows that three verses of the stanza rhyme to
one another, or that one of them be a blank verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the stanzas of five verses the first and third may rhyme,
and the second and two last; as,</p>

<p class='c014'>See also an instance of a stanza of five verses, where the

first and third verses are composed but of four syllables each.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In this stanza the two first and the last, and the third and

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The stanzas of seven verses are frequent enough in our
poetry, especially among the ancients, who composed many
of their poems in this sort of stanza; see the example of one
of them taken from Spenser in the "Ruins of Time," where
the first and third verses rhyme to one another, the second,
fourth, and fifth, and the two last.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I have rather chosen to take notice of this stanza, because
that poet and Chaucer have made use of it in many of their
poems, though they have not been followed in it by any of
the moderns, whose stanzas of seven verses are generally
composed as follows.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Either the four first verses are a quadran in alternate

<p class='c014'>The stanzas of nine and of eleven syllables are not so
frequent as those of five and seven. Spenser has composed
his "Fairy Queen" in stanzas of nine verses, where the first
rhymes to the third, the second to the fourth, fifth and
seventh, and the sixth to the last; but this stanza is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>difficult to maintain, and the unlucky choice of it reduced
him often to the necessity of making use of many exploded
words; nor has he, I think, been followed in it by any of
the moderns, whose six first verses of the stanzas that consist
of nine are generally in rhymes that follow one another,
and the three last a triplet; as,</p>

      <div class='c008'>—<i>Cowley.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the following example the like rhyme is to be observed,
but the verses differ in measure from the former,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The stanzas consisting of eleven verses are yet less frequent
than those of nine, and have nothing particular to be
observed in them. Take an example of one of them, where
the six first are three couplets, the three next a triplet, the
two last a couplet; and where the fourth, the seventh, and
the last verses are of ten syllables each, the others of eight,</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section VII.</span>—<i>Of Pindaric odes, and poems in blank verse.</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>The stanzas of Pindaric odes are neither confined to a certain
number of verses, nor the verses to a certain number of
syllables, nor the rhymes to a certain distance. Some
stanzas contain fifty verses or more, others not above ten, and
sometimes not so many; some verses fourteen, nay, sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>syllables, others not above four: sometimes the rhymes
follow one another for several couplets together, sometimes
they are removed six verses from each other; and
all this in the same stanza. Cowley was the first who
introduced this sort of poetry into our language: nor can
the nature of it be better described than as he himself has
done it, in one of the stanzas of his ode upon liberty, which
I will transcribe, not as an example, for none can properly
be given where no rule can be prescribed; but to give an
idea of the nature of this sort of poetry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>"If Life should a well-order'd Poem be,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>The more heroick Strain let others take,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>The Matter shall be grave, the Numbers loose and free;</div>

      <div class='line in1'>In the same Tune it shall not always Chime,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>A thousand Liberties it shall dispense,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And yet shall manage all without Offence,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or to the Sweetness of the Sound, or Greatness of the Sense,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor shall it ever from one Subject start,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Nor seek Transitions to depart;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor its set Way o'er Stiles and Bridges make,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Nor thro' Lanes a compass take,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As if fear'd some Trespass to commit,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>When the wide Air's a Road for it.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So the Imperial Eagle does not stay</div>

      <div class='line in3'>That's fall'n into his Pow'r,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As if his gen'rous Hunger understood,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That he can never want Plenty of Food;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>He only sucks the tasteful Blood,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And to fresh Game flies cheerfully away,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To Kites and meaner Birds, he leaves the mangled Prey."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This sort of poetry is employed in all manner of subjects;
in pleasant, in grave, in amorous, in heroic, in philosophical,
in moral, and in divine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Blank verse is where the measure is exactly kept without
rhyme. Shakespeare, to avoid the troublesome constraint of
rhyme, was the first who invented it; our poets since him
have made use of it in many of their tragedies and comedies;
but the most celebrated poem in this kind of verse is Milton's
"Paradise Lost," from the fifth book of which I have taken the
following lines for an example of blank verse.</p>

Thomas Carlyle, Professor Wilson, and others.</p>

<p class='c034'><b>Times.</b>—The work is enriched by letters which his two surviving
daughters have brought out of long-closed repositories.... In
taking leave of this creditable book, we thank Mr. Page for his
labour of love, and congratulate him on the collaboration that he has
been favoured with.</p>

<p class='c034'><b>Academy.</b>—At last we are indulged with a Life of De Quincey, ...
and we are mistaken if the result be not to set Thomas de Quincey
on a higher pinnacle as a man with conduct and conscience, a man
with responsible family relations, a true gentleman as well as a cultivated
scholar, than he had hitherto reached. The author is one
practised in kindred pursuits, and has had the great advantage of Mr.
James Hogg's reminiscences of De Quincey, as well as free access to
De Quincey's daughters, and the papers and documents in their
possession.</p>

<p class='c034'><b>Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—This biography deserves to be commended.
Mr. Page's mastery of the subject is evident, and his criticism exhibits
many delicate touches.... Among the reminiscences, those
by Mr. Hogg will be read with special interest; they give us a life-like
portrait of De Quincey, and tell some quaint anecdotes, which
give us a better insight into some of his characteristics than the most
elaborate disquisition.</p>

<p class='c034'><b>Illustrated London News.</b>—It would be as well to consult these two
volumes before any rash assertion be made that everybody knows all
that can be known, or is worthy of being known, about the celebrated
"English Opium-Eater."</p>

<p class='c034'><b>New York Herald.</b>—After reading Mr. Page's biography, we have a
very home-like feeling for De Quincey, and we cannot help saying,
"Dear old man!" as we read his letters.... Mr. Hogg's reminiscences
are very entertaining, and show the genial side of De Quincey's
nature; and Dr. Eatwell's medical view is curious and interesting.
Altogether Mr. Page's Life of De Quincey is one of the most
valuable books of the year, and is as full of anecdote as a nut is of meat.</p>

<p class='c034'><b>Glasgow Herald.</b>—Mr. Page merits great praise for the pains he has
taken to fix De Quincey's position in literature, and to trace the
workings of a mind richly endowed indeed with gifts, even when
measured by the standard of his own bright compeers.</p>

  <h2 class='c035'>FOOTNOTES:</h2>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The derivation of this vulgarism is ancient, and not very
dignified. "Sewer" and "shore," meaning a drain, are,
of course, the same word. It seems absurd, when we have
so few vowels, to allow the distinctive sound of any of them
to be lost, as it would be in this case, by the "o" and "u"
becoming interchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. There is one decided advantage to the public which
would accrue from the teaching of versification in schools.
We should be saved the infliction of much nonsense, published
under the name of poetry. For it is to be hoped that
no man, who had been well-grounded in the mechanism of
verse as a lad, would think of publishing in mature age what
he would know were but school-exercises only, and not
poems.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. An instance of the contrary effect will be found in Tennyson's
line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Long lines of cliff breaking had left a chasm."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here the proper stress should be "breaki'ng," according to
scansion, but the accent thrown back on the first syllable gives
a sudden sort of halt suggestive of the fall of the cliff.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Yet this is not all that is requisite to make music. Browning,
I think I may say, never repeats the same sound; Tennyson
frequently does; yet the latter's verse has a better flow
than the former's. But this may be the result of other arts
employed by the Laureate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The cæsura in some cases falls at the end of the foot.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. The name Pentameter (<i>five</i>-foot) is derived from the long
syllables being incomplete feet, and counting together as one,
so as to make five with the four dactyls. In anapæstics and
iambics the <i>metre</i> is a dipod, <i>i.e.</i>, it includes two feet, so that
an iambic dimeter contains not two but four iambics.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. He, however, seems to have been curiously ignorant of the
ever-changing nature of English pronunciation. When Pope
rhymed "line" and "join," and "obey" and "tea," it was
the fashion to pronounce "join" as "jine" and "tea" as
"tay." Bysshe also finds fault with lines on points of accent,
and condemns some in which "envy´," "e´ssay," "i´nsults,"
and "e´xpert" occur, being apparently unacquainted with the
difference of accent, which is admissible in each instance; and
which, in some, has now superseded the style in fashion in
his time.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Alliteration is a means, not an end. So long as alliterative
verse pleases the ear, and yet does not betray to its reader the
cause of the pleasant sensation, it is an admirable addition to
the beauty of the verse. But as soon as it attracts the reader's
attention, as a <i>tour de force</i>, it is a blot, because it inflicts an
injury on the poem by engaging the mind on the machinery
instead of the matter. Instead of thinking how exquisite the
poem is, we are wondering how often that clever contortionist,
the poet, will fling his summersault of alliteration.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. The spondee (two long syllables) can have no equivalent
in accent, as it would need two accented syllables next to each
other, which can only be used very exceptionally.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. In the classic measures a long ( — ) is equivalent to two
short (  ᴗ ) quantities, in the English feet it is the unaccented
syllables (which we may rudely consider the shorts) which are
capable of resolution. In spite of this difference, however,
it seems most simple to keep the old terms, and use the old
formulæ.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Various forms of stanza may be combined in one poem
(though most usually in the ode only), provided regard be had
to harmony and unity, so that the metres be not varied unsuitably
or violently.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. In couplets, the two lines, in triplets (with two exceptional
forms) the three, rhyme together. In quatrains usually the alternate
lines rhyme. As the lines of the stanza increase in number,
the methods of rhyming of course vary.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. See also Shelley's "Queen Mab."</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. This is the simple decasyllabic, the peculiarity being a
division into stanzas of three lines.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. It is a curious confirmation of my theory about the Cockney
grounds for objection to this rhyme, that the author of a handbook
who condemns "heart" and "art" as a rhyme, fails to
see any fault in "dawn" and "morn," or in "applaud" and
"aboard" as rhymes. Of course, where the "h" is mute as in
"hour," it cannot rhyme with the simple vowel as in "our,"
sound being the test of rhyme, and the ear the only judge. A
"rhyme to the eye" is an impossibility.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. This does not apply to the generous use of a rhyme at the
half-line to mark the cæsural pause, as in this line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"'Twas in the prime of summer time."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nor is there any objection—but rather the contrary—to the use
of two rhyming words in a line, provided they are not identical
with the final rhymes, as for example—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in3'>"That thrice the human span</div>
      <div class='line'>Through <i>gale</i> and <i>hail</i> and fiery bolt</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Had stood erect as man."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. I would, however, warn the beginner not to adopt the
license of loose rhyming, which in Barham is lost sight of amid
the brightness of the wit.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. This and similar words cannot (see Chap. VI.) stand at
the end of serious verse. In comic verse it is different.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. I have reprinted in the Appendix so much of the introductory
matter of "The Young Poet's Guide" (on which this
treatise is founded) as appears to me to contain hints that
may be read with profit, even though it differs slightly from
my views.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. The absurdity of talking of perfect and imperfect rhymes
is only equalled by that of speaking of good grammar and
bad grammar. A shilling is a shilling—what the vulgar call
"a bad shilling" is no shilling at all.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. In words ending in "y," with an accent on the antipenultimate,
there should be no attempt to make "single" rhymes.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. The union of <i>sound</i> alone constitutes rhyme. You do not
match colours by the nose, or sounds by the eye.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. But decidedly ought not to be.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. Here we have the old blunder of taking the licenses of poets
as laws for versifiers.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. Why "pëa"?—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. But it falls at end of the word—the English cæsura never
divides a word as the classic one does. In the second instance
the "is" being enclitic is practically part of the word.—T.H.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
